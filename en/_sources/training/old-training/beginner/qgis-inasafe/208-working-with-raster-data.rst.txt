Module 8: Working with Raster Data
==================================

**Learning Objectives**

- Create raster data 
- Change raster symbology
- Perform terrain analysis

Thus far we’ve worked mostly with vector data, which consists of features, and
these features are themselves made up of points and lines. In this module we
will learn about raster data. Remember when you were editing OpenStreetMap in
JOSM? The points, lines and shapes that you drew were vector data. But when you
loaded Bing aerial imagery in the background, that was raster data. So what’s
the difference?

Raster data essentially comes in the form of an image. It is made up of pixels,
like a photograph, and a raster image will always be some number of pixels wide
and some number of pixels high. If you zoom in far enough on a raster image, it
will start to become blurry, just as if you opened a photo on your computer and
zoomed in very close. As we’ll see in this module, however, a raster image can
mean more than just a photograph from the sky. Follow along and we’ll learn all
about rasters!

1. Loading raster data
----------------------

1. Open the project named :file:`sleman_2_7.qgs` in the directory :file:`qgis/`.
   We’ve simplified the project since the last module to make it easier to
   follow along, and so that our layers load a bit faster. However,
   if you are comfortable you can easily carry on with your project from the
   previous module.

2. Click on the :guilabel:`Load Raster Layer` button:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image147.*
   :align: center

3. The Load Raster Layer dialog will open. Find the file in the directory
   :file:`Sleman/` named :file:`Sleman.tif`. Open it.

4. QGIS will open a dialog which explains that the new layer does not have a
   CRS assigned. In the box at the bottom, scroll down until you find
   **WGS 84 / UTM zone 49S**. Select it and click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image148.*
   :align: center

5. When the raster layer loads, be sure to drag it to the bottom of the
   list in the Layers panel.

6. If you can’t see the raster layer, you may need to enable 'on the fly'
   transformations. To do so:

   - Go to :menuselection:`Project ‣ Project Properties...`
   - Check the box next to :guilabel:`Enable 'on the fly' CRS transformation`.
   - Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image149.*
   :align: center

The raster should display nicely underneath your vector data layers.

..  _changing-raster-symbology:

2. Changing raster symbology
----------------------------

Not all raster data consists of aerial photographs. There are many other
forms of raster data, and in many of those cases,
it’s essential to symbolise the data so that it becomes properly
visible and useful. In this section we’ll add a new kind of raster and see
how to change it’s symbology.

7. First let’s remove our previous raster image so that our project will load
   faster. Right-click on the :guilabel:`Sleman` layer and click 
   :guilabel:`Remove`.

8. Click on the :guilabel:`Load Raster Layer` button:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image147.*
   :align: center

9. Open the file named :file:`SRTM_Sleman.tif`, which is located in
   :file:`Sleman/SRTM/`.

10. When it appears in the Layers panel, right-click on it and click
    :guilabel:`Rename`. Give it the name :kbd:`DEM`.

.. note:: This dataset is a Digital Elevation Model (DEM). It’s a map of the
   elevation (altitude) of the terrain, showing us where the mountains and
   valleys are. In an aerial photograph, each pixel in the image is a colour.
   When we view all of these different coloured pixels together,
   they show us something we can understand - the Earth as viewed from above.
   In  a DEM, each pixel has a different value instead of colour. The value of
   each pixel represents elevation.

When it loads, you’ll notice that the new raster image appears as a grey
rectangle. It’s seen here with the roads layers on top:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image151.*
   :align: center

The layer appears grey (and doesn’t give us any information) because its
symbology hasn’t been customised yet. In the colour aerial photograph we
loaded previously, everything is already defined. But if you load a raster
image and it’s just a grey rectangle, then you know there’s no symbology for
it yet. It still needs to be defined. That’s what we will do next.

11. Open the Layer Properties dialog for the SRTM layer,
    which is now named :guilabel:`DEM`.

12. Switch to the :guilabel:`Style` tab. This shows the current symbology 
    settings, and as we’ve seen, they don’t give us much information on the 
    layer. Let’s make sure the layer has data in it.

13. Change the :guilabel:`Render type` to :guilabel:`Singleband pseudocolor`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image152.*
   :align: center

14. Click :guilabel:`OK`. The raster should look like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image153.*
   :align: center

Good! This tells us that there is data in this layer. And by looking at
it we can get an idea of where the elevation gets higher. In the north we
can see the location of Mount Merapi.

Let’s stop for a minute and understand what is happening here. Remember
that an image is made up of pixels, individual cells that contain a value,
which is usually a colour value. For example, if you zoom in very closely on
a photograph you can see those individual pixels, like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image154.*
  :align: center

The value of each cell is saved in the file. Imagine the file being saved
something like this, where each square is a pixel:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image155.*
   :align: center

Of course the computer doesn’t understand words for colours. In fact the
value of each cell would be a number, which the computer then associates
with a certain colour. For our aerial image, this is already defined. Since
it is a normal image, it knows to associate the numbers for each pixel in
the file with the common colours that we see every day. But this new raster
image is different, because the values of each pixel don’t represent colours,
but rather altitude, and QGIS doesn’t know automatically how to display it.
Hence it shows every pixel in the image as grey, even if the values in each
pixel are different. When we change the symbology to Psuedocolor,
we can see all the different pixel values shown with various colours.

It would be nice to represent our DEM layer as a greyscale spectrum,
rather than a variety of bright colours.. Next we will tell QGIS to
symbolise the layer with colours in a spectrum, beginning at the lowest pixel
value in the file and ending at the highest pixel value. In other words,
if the pixel values looked like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image156.*
   :align: center

QGIS would create a spectrum equating numbers to colours like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image157.*
   :align: center

And render the image like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image158.*
   :align: center

15. Open the Layer Properties again.

16. Switch the render type back to :guilabel:`Singleband gray` (1).

17. Check the box next to :guilabel:`Min / max` (2).

18. Next to :guilabel:`Contrast enhancement`, select
    :guilabel:`Stretch to MinMax` (3).

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image159.*
   :align: center

But what are the minimum and maximum values that should be used?  The
current values are those that
just gave us a grey rectangle. Instead, we should be using the
minimum and maximum pixel values that are actually in the image. You can
determine those values easily by loading the minimum and maximum values of
the raster.

19. Under :guilabel:`Load min / max values`, select 
    :guilabel:`Estimate (faster)`.

20. Click the :guilabel:`Load` button:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image160.*
   :align: center

Notice how the custom :guilabel:`Min` and :guilabel:`Max` values have changed. 
The lowest pixel value in this image file is 0 and the highest is about 3294.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image161.*
   :align: center

21. Click :guilabel:`OK`. You should see the values of the raster properly
    displayed, with the darker colours representing valleys and the lighter 
    ones, mountains:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image162.*
   :align: center

We’ve learned to do this the tricky way, but can we do it faster? Of
course! Now that you understand what needs to be done,
you’ll be glad to know that there’s a tool for doing all of this more easily.

22. Remove :guilabel:`DEM` from the Layers panel, by right-clicking it and
    clicking :menuselection:`Remove`.

23. Load the raster image again, renaming it to :guilabel:`DEM` as before. It will be a
    grey rectangle again.

24. Enable the tool you’ll need by enabling
    :menuselection:`View ‣ Toolbars ‣ Raster`. These icons will appear in the
    interface:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image163.*
   :align: center

The button on the right will stretch the minimum and maximum values to give
you the best contrast in the local area that you’re zoomed into. It’s useful
for large datasets. The button on the left will stretch the minimum and
maximum values to constant values across the whole image.

25. Click the left button labelled :guilabel:`(Stretch Histogram to Full Dataset)`.
    You’ll see the data is now correctly represented as before! Easy!


3. Terrain analysis
-------------------

Certain types of rasters allow you to gain more insight into the terrain
that they represent. Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) are particularly useful
in this regard. In this section we’ll do a little bit more with our DEM
raster, in order to try to extract more information from it.

3.1  Calculating a hillshade
............................

The DEM you have on your map right now does show you the elevation of the
terrain, but it can sometimes seem a little abstract. It contains all the 3D
elevation information about the terrain that you need,
but it doesn’t really look 3-Dimensional. To get a better look at the
terrain, it is possible to calculate a hillshade, which is a raster that
maps the terrain using light and shadow to create a 3D-looking image.

To work with DEMs, we will use the all-in-one DEM (Terrain models)
analysis tool.

26. Go to :menuselection:`Raster ‣ Analysis ‣ DEM (Terrain models)`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image164.*
   :align: center

27. In the dialog that appears, ensure that the input file is the :kbd:`DEM` 
    layer.

28. Set the output file to :kbd:`hillshade.tif` in the directory
    :file:`qgis/Sleman/`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image165.*
   :align: center

29. Check the box next to :guilabel:`Load into canvas when finished`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image166.*
   :align: center

30. Leave all the other options unchanged.

31. Click :guilabel:`OK` to generate the hillshade.

32. When the processing is complete, click :guilabel:`OK` on the notification.

33. Click :guilabel:`Close` in the dialog.

There should now be a new layer called :guilabel:`hillshade` that looks like 
this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image167.*
   :align: center

This looks more Three-Dimensional, but can we improve on this?  On its own,
the hillshade looks like a plaster cast. It will look better if we can
combine it with our more colourful DEM. We can do this by making the
hillshade layer an overlay.

3.2  Using a hillshade as an overlay
....................................

A hillshade can provide very useful information about the sunlight at a
given time of day. But it can also be used for aesthetic purposes,
to make the map look better. The key to this is setting the hillshade to
being mostly transparent.

34. Change the symbology of the original :guilabel:`DEM` layer to use 
    the :guilabel:`Pseudocolor` scheme.

35. Hide all the layers except the DEM and hillshade layers.

36. Click and drag the :guilabel:`DEM` layer beneath the :guilabel:`hillshade` 
    layer in the Layers panel.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image168.*
   :align: center

37. Ensure that :guilabel:`Control rendering order` is checked.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image169.*
  :align: center

38. Now we will make the hillshade layer somewhat transparent. Open its
    Layer Properties and go to the :guilabel:`Transparency` tab.

39. Set the :guilabel:`Global transparency` to 50%:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image170.*
   :align: center

40. Click :guilabel:`OK` in the Layer Properties dialog. You should get a
    result similar to this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/qgis-inasafe/image171.*
   :align: center

41. Switch the :guilabel:`hillshade` layer off and on in the Layers panel to 
    see the difference it makes.

Using a hillshade in this way, it’s possible to enhance the topography of
the landscape. If the effect doesn’t seem strong enough to you,
you can change the transparency of the hillshade layer; but of course,
the brighter the hillshade becomes, the dimmer the colours behind it will be.
You will need to find a balance that works for you.
