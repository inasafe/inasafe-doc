Module 5: Field Papers
======================

**Learning Objectives**

- Understand how to use Field Papers
- Make and print Field Papers
- Add information to Field Papers
- Scan and upload Field Papers to `fieldpapers.org <http://fieldpapers.org>`_
- Open Field Papers in JOSM

In this module we will see how it is possible to record the coordinates of 
places without a GPS. We will use a tool called Field Papers,
which allows you to print a map of an area, draw on it and add notes,
and load the paper back into JOSM, where you can add your locations to
OpenStreetMap.

1. Overview
-----------

Before going into detail about Field Papers, let’s look at an overview of
how the process works:

**Step 1:**  Locate the area you want to map on the Field Papers website.
Print out a map of this area. You can choose to print the current map of
the area with OSM, or you can choose to print aerial imagery,
if it is available in your area.

**Step 2:**  Use your printed map to survey the area. Add more places by
drawing them on the map. Draw lines for roads, shapes for buildings,
and so forth. Write notes about each location directly on the map,
or write numbers on the map that relate to numbers in your notebook,
where you can record more detailed information about each object.

**Step 3:**  Scan your paper into the computer. If you do not have a
scanner, you can take a photograph of the paper, if your camera is able to
take high quality pictures. Upload the image to the Field Papers website
(`http://fieldpapers.org/upload.php <http://fieldpapers.org/upload.php>`_).

**Step 4:** In JOSM, load the Field Paper. Use the objects you drew as a
reference to add them digitally into OSM.

2. How does Field Papers work?
------------------------------

If you follow the Field Papers process described above,
you will be collecting accurate geographic coordinates of places with
nothing more than paper. How is this possible?

When you print a Field Paper, it comes with a square barcode on the
bottom of the page. This bar code allows Field Papers to determine the
exact location of the map that you are using to survey. Later,
when you load the paper back into JOSM, all the objects that you drew will
be in shown in their actual locations, or at least quite close,
which is good enough for us.

Next let’s learn how to create and use Field Papers.

3. Create and print
-------------------

1. Open your web browser - this may be Firefox, Chrome, Opera,
   or Internet Explorer.

2. In the address bar at the top of the window, enter 
   `http://fieldpapers.org/ <http://fieldpapers.org>`_ and
   press :kbd:`Enter`.

The website should look something like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image71.*
   :align: center

3. Click :guilabel:`Make yourself an Atlas`.

4. Enter the name of a place where you would like to print out a map,
   and press :kbd:`Enter`. In this example we will search for :kbd:`jakarta`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image72.*
   :align: center

Now you are presented with an interface where you can define the
boundaries of your Field Paper. The map that you see shows the area that
you would like to print on paper. You can print multiple pages,
zoom in and out, and drag the papers to cover specific boundaries on the map.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image73.*

5. Click on the various buttons to see what each does. Notice that in our
   example we are presented with a two page set of Field Papers. To add or
   subtract a page, click on the :guilabel:`+` and :guilabel:`-` buttons
   on the map. It may be easiest to create only one page the first time
   that you use Field Papers.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image74.*

6. Expand or decrease the area of the papers by dragging the button in
   the lower right corner.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image75.*
   :align: center

7. Move the paper by clicking and dragging the button in the upper left corner.

   :align: center

8. Adjust the paper orientation and type of map using the controls at the top.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image77.*
   :align: center

9. When you are finished adjusting the parameters, click :guilabel:`Next`.

10. Give your map a name, and if you want, you can add notes to be
    printed on the map, such as questions you want to remember to answer or
    specific places you want to identify. Then click :guilabel:`Next`.

11. Finally choose your layout. Indicate whether you want pages only
    for your maps, or if you want notes on the same page. If you choose the
    notes option, then half of the page will be left for taking notes,
    and the other half will contain the map.

12. It may take a few minutes to prepare your Field Paper.

13. When the print is ready, scroll to the bottom and click
    :guilabel:`Download PDF`. The Field Paper should begin downloading.
    If it loads in your browser, you may need to save it by going 
    to :menuselection:`File ‣ Save`.

14. When the download is finished, open the PDF file. Connect your computer
    to a printer and print the page. If everything goes well,
    you should now have your map printed on paper.

4. Map with Field Papers
------------------------

15. Take your Field Paper outside, and use it as a guide to walk and identify
    new places that are not on the map.

16. Draw lines for roads, shapes for buildings, and so forth. Write notes
    about each location directly on the map, or write numbers on the map that
    relate to numbers in your notebook, where you can write more detailed
    information about each object.

When you are satisfied with your additions on the paper map,
then you are ready to add them digitally into OSM.

5. Scan and upload
------------------

17. Field Papers are useful for mapping with nothing more than paper,
    but they are not 100% magic. We will still need to add our paper into JOSM,
    add our information digitally and save the changes on OSM.

18. The first step is to scan your Field Paper. Do this by
    attaching a scanner to your computer, scanning the paper
    and saving it as an image file. If you don’t have a scanner,
    take a photograph of the paper, but be careful to take
    a good  quality photo. Make sure that the paper is flat and the camera
    is directly in front of it. Be sure to include the barcode in the image,
    as Field Papers will not work without it. Here is an example of a
    scanned/photographed image:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image68.*
   :align: center

19. Once your Field Paper is scanned and saved on the computer,
    open your web browser and return to the
    http://fieldpapers.org/ just as before.

20. Click the :guilabel:`Upload` tab at the top of the page.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image80.*
   :align: center

21. Click :guilabel:`Choose File` and navigate to the file where you
    scanned/photographed your Field Paper.

22. Click :guilabel:`Upload`. It may take a few minutes for the paper to 
    upload, depending on the speed of your internet connection.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image81.*
   :align: center

23. You’ll be able to add additional notes to your Field Paper,
    but we will skip this for now. Click :guilabel:`Finished`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image82.*
   :align: center

6. Open in JOSM
---------------

When the scan has been processed, it can be added as a background layer
in JOSM. To display Field Papers in JOSM, the fieldpapers plugin must
be installed.

24. Open JOSM and go to :menuselection:`Edit ‣ Preferences`.

25. Go to the :guilabel:`Plugins` tab.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image83.*
   :align: center

26. Type :kbd:`fieldpapers` in the :guilabel:`Search` box. After it is found,
    check the box next to it. Click :guilabel:`OK` and restart JOSM.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image84.*
   :align: center

27. Open your browser and go to the `Field Papers website <http://fieldpapers.org>`_.

28. Click :guilabel:`Watch`. Then move your mouse to the bottom and click
    :guilabel:`Snapshots`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image85.*
   :align: center

29. You will see all of the Field Papers that users around the world have 
    uploaded. Find your image, and then click on it.

30. We need the URL to load the Field Paper into JOSM. The URL is the web
    address at the top of the page, which will be something like: 
    *http://fieldpapers.org/snapshot.php?id=67v87z5n#18/-5.15534/119.43913*
  
    Copy the URL by selecting it and pressing :kbd:`CTRL + C`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image86.*
   :align: center

31. Open JOSM. Since you installed the plugin, there should be a new Field 
    Papers menu at the top.

32. Go to :menuselection:`Field Papers ‣ Scanned Map` and paste the URL by
    pressing :kbd:`Ctrl + V` on your keyboard.

33. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image87.*
   :align: center

34. Wait a moment until the Field Paper appears in your JOSM layers.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/beginner/osm/image88.*
   :align: center

Now you have a Field Papers layer that can be used as a reference to
add OSM data. It is like using imagery to identify objects on the ground,
but instead there are detailed drawings and notes from your field survey.
Later, when we have learned to access OSM data through JOSM, this can be 
used as a reference to edit the map.
