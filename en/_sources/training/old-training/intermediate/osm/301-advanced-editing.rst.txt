Module 1: Advanced Editing
==========================

**Learning Objectives**

- Use advanced editing tools in JOSM
- Make relations among objects

Welcome to the intermediate guide for spatial data collection with
OpenStreetMap. In the previous unit you learned how to draw points, lines
and shapes in JOSM, how to open your GPS waypoints and tracks in JOSM and how
to download, edit and upload your changes on OSM. In this module,
we will describe relations, JOSM editing tools and editing techniques in
greater detail.

.. note:: While this module is not extremely advanced, it is a step higher than
   the previous unit. If you don’t feel like you fully understand the
   lessons leading up to this, you may wish to practise a little bit more
   before continuing.


1. Advanced editing tools
-------------------------

There are a few ways you can access more editing tools in JOSM. We will look
more at the default tools, as well as additional tools available through 
plugins. 

1.1 Default drawing tools
.........................

JOSM has some additional tools to make it easier to draw lines and shapes.
These tools are found in the :menuselection:`Tools` menu at the top of JOSM.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image7.*
   :align: center

In order to apply the functions in this menu, you must first select a point,
line or shape in the map window. Some of the most useful functions are
described here:

Split Way
^^^^^^^^^
This allows you to divide a line into two separate lines. This
is useful if you want to add different attributes to different parts of a
road, such as a bridge. To use this function, select a point in the middle
of the line that you want to split, go to :menuselection:`Tools ‣ Split Way`
and your line should be split in two.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image8.*
   :align: center

Combine Way
^^^^^^^^^^^
This does the opposite of :guilabel:`Split Way`. To combine
two lines into a single line, they must share a single point. To use this
function, select both lines that you want to combine. You can select more
than one object by holding the :kbd:`SHIFT` key on your keyboard and
clicking on each line. When you have selected both lines,
go to :menuselection:`Tools ‣ Combine Way`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image9.*
   :align: center

Note that you if are combining roads that have different directions,
you might get this warning:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image10.*
   :align: center

If the roads are connected and go in the same direction, click
:guilabel:`Reverse and Combine`.

Reverse Way
^^^^^^^^^^^
This will change the direction of the line. If the line
incorrectly represents a road or river that is one-way, you may want to
change its direction. Unless someone has intentionally created a way to be
one way you do not usually have to worry about altering the direction
because ways in OSM default to represent both directions.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image11.*
   :align: center

Simplify Way
^^^^^^^^^^^^
If your line has too many nodes in it and you’d like to
make it simpler, this will remove some of the points from a line.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image12.*
   :align: center

Create Circle OR Align Nodes in Circle
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
If you are trying to make a
circular shape, draw the circle as best you can and then select three nodes
and the function. It will help arrange your points in a circle.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image13.*
   :align: center

Align Nodes in Line 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This function will align a series of points into a
straight line. With long lines it is best to select sections of the line to
straighten. Be careful as this does have the tendency to shift the line a
little.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image14.*
   :align: center

Orthogonalize Shape 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This function is very useful for drawing regular
shapes such as buildings. After you draw an area, this function will reshape
it to have square corners. This feature is most useful for other regularly
shaped features, such as tennis courts or landuse areas (Using the
Building Plugin, which is explained below, might be easier
for buildings).

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image15.*
   :align: center

Unglue Ways 
^^^^^^^^^^^
This tool allows you to detach nodes that are connected.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image16.*
   :align: center

.. Note:: The line and node will not actually appear separate as the last
   screenshot implies.

1.2 Plugins
...........

Building Plugin
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image17.*

This plugin is by far one of the most useful tools for editing (digitising).
Install it as with any other plugin. It will appear as an icon on the left hand
toolbar. The functionality of this tool is explained here:

The Building tool allows you to create shapes with 90 degree
corners with just three clicks. First, trace the edge of the building
and then drag out the line to make it a polygon.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image18.*
   :align: center

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image19.*
   :align: center

You can also create more complicated buildings by using the merge option.
Create your building outline, select all of the polygons (press :kbd:`SHIFT`
to highlight them all) and then press :kbd:`SHIFT + J` to merge the objects.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image20.*
   :align: center

Furthermore, you can also change the default settings (size of building and 
default tags) by going to :menuselection:`Data ‣ Set building size`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image21.*
   :align: center

This is useful if you are drawing many buildings of a known dimension (such as
five by six metres). If you are mapping infrastructure which requires tags
other than **building=yes**, you can set the desired default tags by going to
:guilabel:`Advanced...`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image22.*
   :align: center


Utilsplugin2 (More Tools)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The plugin utilsplugin2 has several features that are also useful for editing.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image23.*
   :align: center

After you install this plugin, a new menu will appear called
:menuselection:`More Tools`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image24.*
   :align: center

The following tools are some of the most useful:

Add Nodes at Intersections
##########################
This tool is helpful for adding
missing nodes in intersections of selected ways. It is good practice that
roads and rivers should always have common nodes where they intersect.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image25.*
   :align: center

Copy Tags from Previous Selection
#################################
This function makes copying tags
easier. If you want to create many objects with the same tags, first draw
the objects. Then add the tags to one object. Click on another object and
press :kbd:`Shift + R` to copy the tags from the previously selected object.
You can do this for all objects that you want to tag. Remember that the tags
will be copied from the previously selected object, so if you click on an
untagged object and then another untagged object, you will not be able to
copy any tags.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image26.*
   :align: center

Add Source Tag 
##############
This tool simplifies adding a source tag. It remembers
the source that was specified last and adds it as remembered source tag to
your objects. You can insert the source with just one click.

Replace Geometry
################
This tool is great if you want to redraw a poorly shaped
object, but want to keep the history, attributes and ID number of that
object. For example, if you come across a building that is complicated and
drawn in a poor fashion, then instead of painfully changing each node, you
can (2) just draw the object again (3) select the old and new object (4)
press :guilabel:`Replace Geometry` to transfer all the information over.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image27.*
   :align: center


Utilsplugin2 also provides a new selection menu that provides more tools:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image28.*
   :align: center

These tools are some of the most useful:

Unselect Nodes
##############
This tool allows you to deselect nodes, which makes it useful for tagging 
the objects selected. This tool is necessary if you have mapped several 
polygon objects with similar attributes and would like to tag the objects 
without tagging the nodes. To do so, select all of the objects - polygons, 
ways and relations. Then unselect the nodes and tag appropriately.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image29.*
   :align: center

Select Last Modified Nodes
##########################
This tool permits you to go back to the
nodes that you most recently changed.

2. Relations
------------

In the first unit we learned that there are three types of objects that can be
drawn in OSM - points (nodes), lines (ways) and polygons. Lines
contain numerous points, and the line itself carries the attributes that define
what it represents. Polygons are the same as lines, except that the the line
must finish where it begins in order to form a shape.

In fact, there is one other type of object in OSM, and these are
called relations. In the same way that a line consists of other points, a
relation contains a group of other objects, be they points, lines or polygons.
If you are looking to obtain advanced editing skills, then understanding and
knowing how to properly edit relations is important.

For example, imagine that you want to map a building that has courtyards in the
centre. You would need to draw a polygon around the outside of the building,
and you would need other polygons around the courtyards to indicate that they
are not part of the building. This is an example of a relation. The relation
would contain several polygons - and the attributes of the building would be
attached to the relation, not the polygons.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image30.*
   :align: center

Relations are used to represent anything that requires a collection of objects
to define. Other examples are bus routes (a collections of lines), long and
complex objects (rivers or roads), or multiple polygons that are all part of one
location (like buildings in a university).

There are mainly four types of relations you will encounter in OSM:
**Multipolygons, Routes, Boundaries and Restrictions**.
In this section we will go over Multipolygons and Routes.

2.1 Editing relations
.....................

The multipolygon above contains a polygon for the outer limits of the building
and two more to mark the inner courtyards. To create a relation from these three
polygons we need to:

1. Select all of the polygons.

2. Go to :menuselection:`Tools ‣ Create multipolygon`

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image31.*
   :align: center

The polygons should automatically be created as a multi-polygon.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image32.*
   :align: center

3. Click the :guilabel:`Edit` button in the :guilabel:`Tags` tab.

This opens the relation editor. Notice that in the lower-left corner is a list
of the members of the relation. One has been automatically defined with the
role of "outer" (the outer polygon), and the other carries the role of "inner."

At the top are a list of the tags applied to this relation. Right now only one
tag exists, **type=multipolygon**. This tag indicates what type of relation
the object is.

4. Click beneath it and add one more tag: **building=yes**.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image32b.*
   :align: center

5. Click :guilabel:`OK`. The object will change colours and will now appear as 
   a building, but with a courtyard.

The data behind the relation in our example is visible on OSM: You
can see this multipolygon on OSM by going to
http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/relation/2435797.
It will appear on OSM like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image33.*
   :align: center

2.2  Another multipolygon
.........................

The river below is another example of a multipolygon.
Effectively it is the same as the building example, but with a greater number
of members and covering a much larger area.
It can be viewed on OSM here:
http://www.openstreetmap.org/browse/relation/1046961.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image34.*
   :align: center

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image35.*
   :align: center

This river contains ten ways that are connected like a long polygon.

2.3  Linestring relations
.........................

Relations are also very useful for creating, labeling and editing large
linestrings; for example, bus routes, hiking trails, bicycle paths, etc.
These differ from multipolygons because they are relations with members,
as supposed to complex areas.
A linestring could simply be one line with multiple members.
Additional features, such as bus stops represented by separate nodes can also
be tagged as relation members.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image36.*

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image37.*

To create a linestring relation:

6. Make sure that all of the ways in which the route runs along are
   appropriately tagged. For example, **highway=footway**.

7. Select all of the highways or ways that are part of the bus route.
   If you would only like to select certain parts of a way, then
   you must divide the way into sections.
   This creates more work, but you can easily do it with the
   :guilabel:`Split Way` tool.
   
8. Go to :menuselection:`Presets ‣ Transport Public Transport ‣ Route master`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image38.*
   :align: center

9. Fill in the information about the bus route and click 
   :guilabel:`New relation`.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image39.*
   :align: center

Relations are difficult to understand and do not have to be used often,
but they are necessary to know about. As you get more developed with your
OSM skills and want to create more complex buildings, rivers and routes,
relations will be useful.
