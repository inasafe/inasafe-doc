Module 4: Creating JOSM File Presets
====================================

**Learning Objectives**

- Understand tags
- Understand XML
- Understand keys and values
- Make presets
- Put preset files into JOSM
- Apply new presets to an object

By now you probably have a good understanding of how objects are drawn in JOSM,
and how to add information to these objects to describe what they are.
You add attributes to a point, line or shape by attaching tags to it.
By using the JOSM presets menu, you can easily attach the correct tags to an
object by finding the type of object you want to create through a menu,
and then filling in information in a form.
In this module we will review tags and presets once more,
and then learn how we can create our own presets menus to use in JOSM.

1. Tags and presets
-------------------

Remember that after you draw an object on the map in JOSM, you need to attach
tags in order to describe what it is, its name and any other attributes.
For example when you want to create a clothing shop with the name “Some
Clothing Shop”, you need two tags - one to describe the point as a clothing
shop, and one to hold the name.
In JOSM, the tags are shown in the Properties panel when an object is
selected.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image88.*
   :align: center

Tags consist of two parts, the **key** and the **value**.
The key typically defines the type of information you are attaching,
and the value defines the specific object.
Here we have two tags, and hence two pairs of keys and values.

**KEY = VALUE**

**name = Some Clothing Shop**

**shop = clothes**

When we create a point with these tags, JOSM knows to display the icon like
this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image89.*
   :align: center

And when we look at this on the `OpenStreetMap <http://openstreetmap.org>`_
website, the object looks like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image90.*
   :align: center

The reason this works is because we’ve applied the appropriate **tags**.

Because OSM is so open, anybody can add any tags they want to
anything.
But what happens when mappers in England disagree with mappers in Japan about
the best way to tag something?
For example, it is important that all schools have the same tag describing it
as a school.
If some people tag schools as **amenity=school** but others tag them as
**education=school**, it is a problem.
Hence, people must agree on how to tag places.

OSM has been around for many years now, so there is an accepted
standard for how to identify most types of locations, and those are listed on
the Map Features page on the OSM Wiki.

http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Map_Features

This web page has grown longer and longer over the years as people have sought
to map more and more things and have needed more tags to do so.
It is impossible to remember all of these tags, and quite a hassle to look
them up every time you need them.
Hence, JOSM has a Presets menu which makes it much easier to apply the
correct tags to an object.
With the Presets menu, we can easily find the entry for school,
enter information into a form and not have to worry about whether the
correct tag is **amenity=school** or **education=school** or something else
entirely.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image91.*
   :align: center

Notice that when you add attributes using the presets menu,
the correct tags are automatically added in the Properties menu on the right.

JOSM comes with most of the presets that you will need already loaded, but
sometimes you may want to add your own presets to create tags for the specific
type of data you are collecting.
The remainder of this module will explain how to create a custom Presets menu.

2. Introduction to XML
----------------------

In order to create our own Presets menu, we first need to understand a
language called XML.
XML, which stands for *Extensible Mark-up Language*, is a language
similar to HTML.
The key difference is that XML is designed to carry data,
not display it.
Many applications on the internet use XML to transmit data,
including OSM.
XML uses **elements**, and each element can contain child elements inside it.
For example, let’s imagine that we want to create an XML file that contains
data about a restaurant menu.
We must create a **root element** to contain all the data about our menu.
Our root element will have an opening and a closing tag, like this:
::

  <menu>
      ... whatever data we want to include in our menu ...
  </menu>

Information is contained inside an element, and within each element there
can be more elements.
::

  <menu>
    <item name=“Hamburger”>
          <cost>400</cost>
          <description>Delicious beef patty with cheddar cheese</description>
    </item>
    <item name=“Nasi Goreng”>
          <cost>200</cost>
          <description>Traditional Indonesian Fried Rice</description>
     </item>
  </menu>

In this example we have placed two **<item>** elements within our **<menu>**
element to describe two different items that are contained in the menu.
Each item contains two more elements in them, **<cost>** and **<description>**.
Notice also how we have written name=”Hamburger” inside the opening
**<item>** tag.
This is called an attribute, and adds information about the element.

XML Terminology
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

- **root element:**  the outermost element of an XML document, which describes
  what is contained
- **element:**  any XML object, contained by opening and closing tags, such as
  **<item>...data...</item>**
- **tag:**  something contained in brackets, such as **<item>**. **<item>** is
  the opening tag of an element, and **</item>** is the closing tag.
- **attribute:**  a piece of information contained inside a tag, such as
  **name=“Hamburger”**

Using XML to hold and transmit data is great because it is easy to understand
for computers.
To provide one more example, this is what the XML might look like for the
point we created in JOSM previously.
::

  <osm>
     <node id="6799999167" lat="-8.7542864" lon="123.5516224" user="rukeli" uid="923929" visible="true" version="4" changeset="8343565" timestamp="2011-06-04T21:50:42Z">
          <tag k="name" v="Some Clothing Shop"/>
          <tag k="shop" v="clothes"/>
     </node>
  </osm>

This XML has a root element **<osm>** which indicates that OSM data is
contained inside.
Then it has one **<node>** element which is the OSM way of
describing a **point**.
The node has numerous attributes, including a unique id number,
the coordinates of the point, the user who created the point,
and some additional information which we will not discuss right now.
Between the opening **<node>** tag and the closing **</node>** tag there are
two more elements of type **<tag>**.
Each **<tag>** has an attribute k and an attribute v.
These are the keys and values that we added in JOSM.
Notice that the **<tag>** elements don’t have a closing **</tag>**. This is
because they don’t have any other elements contained within them,
but instead have a forward slash indicating that it does not require a
closing tag. **<tag ...attributes />**

3. JOSM presets files
---------------------

As you’ve already discovered, JOSM comes pre-loaded with a presets menu that
includes most common types of geographic options.
But sometimes you want to add additional presets for specific information
that you want to collect.
You can create your own presets menu by writing it in XML,
and then loading it in JOSM.
First, let’s look at how we can load additional presets menus into JOSM.

1. Open JOSM and open the Preferences menu by going to
   :menuselection:`Edit ‣ Preferences`.

2. Click on the third icon from the top which looks like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image92.*
   :align: center

3. Click on the third tab labelled :guilabel:`Tagging Presets`.

4. Select :guilabel:`Buildings by Kate Chapman` and click on the right arrow 
   button to add it to Active presets.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image93.*
   :align: center

5. Click :guilabel:`OK`.

6. Restart JOSM.

7. Create a new layer by going to :menuselection:`File ‣ New Layer`.

8. Create a point and make sure it is selected.

9. Go to the Presets menu.
   You should now see the presets that you added at the bottom.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image95.*
   :align: center

10. Click on :menuselection:`Building` to see the the building presets form.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image94.*
   :align: center

When we added these new presets through the preferences menu, what we were doing
is adding an XML file that describes how the new menu should behave.
In the next sections, we will learn how to create our own XML presets file
that we can load into JOSM.

4. A sample presets file
------------------------

To understand how a presets file is written, let’s first look at the XML for
one of the pre-loaded presets in JOSM.
When you go to the presets menu and select
:menuselection:`Facilities ‣ Culture ‣ Place of Worship` you will see a form
like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image96.*
   :align: center

The XML for this form looks like this:
::

  <item name="Place of Worship" icon="presets/church.*" type="node,closedway,relation">
     <link href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity=place_of_worship" />
     <label text="Edit Place of Worship" />
     <key key="amenity" value="place_of_worship" />
     <text key="name" text="Name" default="" delete_if_empty="true" />
     <combo key="religion" text="Religion" values="bahai,buddhist,christian,hindu,jain,jewish,muslim,sikh,spiritualist,taoist,unitarian,zoroastrian" default="" delete_if_empty="true" />
     <combo key="denomination" text="Denomination" values="anglican,baptist,catholic,evangelical,jehovahs_witness,lutheran,methodist,mormon,orthodox,pentecostal,presbyterian,protestant,quaker,shia,sunni" default="" delete_if_empty="true" />
     <combo key="service_times" text="Service Times" values="Su 10:00,Su 10:30,Su 11:00" default="" delete_if_empty="true" />
     <combo key="opening_hours" text="Opening Hours for visiting" values="24/7,Mo-Fr 08:30-20:00,Tu-Su 08:00-15:00;Sa 08:00-12:00" default="" delete_if_empty="true" />
  </item>

This may look complex, but it is not as difficult as it may seem.
Let’s walk through it line by line.

The first line is the opening tag of our root element **<item>**.
There are several attributes describing the element.

+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| name="Place of Worship"        | The name of what you are creating.                                      |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| icon="presets/church.*"        | The icon of the object. PNGs are the most effective in OSM since they   |
|                                | are compressed low-colour graphics with transparent backgrounds.        |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| type="node,closedway,relation" | The types of object that this preset can be applied to. Node means it   |
|                                | can be applied on a point, way means it can be applied to a line,       |
|                                | closedway means it can be applied to a shape, and relation means it can |
|                                | be applied to a relation, which is a type of OSM object we have not     |
|                                | discussed. Notice that way is not an option here, because a place of    |
|                                | worship cannot be a line - it must be a point or a shape.               |
+--------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

The second line provides a link to the OSM wiki page for this type of
location.

**<link href="http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tag:amenity=place_of_worship" />**

The third line has the tag <label> and describes what text should be shown at
the top of the form.

**<label text="Edit Place of Worship" />**

The fourth line describes a tag that will automatically be applied to the
object when the preset is selected.
In this case, we want the object to have the tag
**amenity=place_of_worship**.

**<key key="amenity" value="place_of_worship" />**

The fifth line describes the first thing that will be shown on our form, and how
to create a tag when it is filled in.
The tag is **<text>** which indicates that the form should have a text box
for the user to fill in.
The attribute key=“name” describes what key should be used when the tag is
created.
The value will be whatever the user enters in the text box.
The attribute **text=“Name”** describes what should be written on the form
next to the text box.
The final attribute indicates that no tag should be created if the text box
is left empty.

**<text key="name" text="Name" default="" delete_if_empty="true" />**

The lines after this are similar, but instead of text boxes, drop-down boxes are
created where the user can select from different options.
The tag used for this is **<combo>**

The final line of the XML is the closing tag **</item>**

5. Creating your own presets file
---------------------------------

Now follow along as we create our own presets file.
We will create an example presets menu which will allow us to tag buildings
or points according to the type of utilities access that they have available.
For this, let’s invent some new tags:

+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| Key                 | Possible Value            |                                                   |
+=====================+===========================+===================================================+
| utility:water       | well, municipal, yes, no  | Does the household have access to water?          |
|                     |                           | well indicates it has access to well water.       |
|                     |                           | municipal indicates it has pipes running to it.   |
|                     |                           | If we want to be less descriptive, we can         |
|                     |                           | select yes or no to indicate if the building      |
|                     |                           | has water access                                  |
+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| utility:electricity | yes, no                   | Does the household have electrical access?        |
+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| utility:phone       | landline, mobile, yes, no | Does the household have phone access? landline    |
|                     |                           | indicates that there is a hard phone line in the  |
|                     |                           | house. mobile indicates that the household has a  |
|                     |                           | mobile phone. If we want to be less descriptive,  |
|                     |                           | we can use yes or no                              |
+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+
| utility:internet    | landline, mobile, yes, no | Same values as for phone, this will indicate if   |
|                     |                           | the household has internet access                 |
+---------------------+---------------------------+---------------------------------------------------+

When the preset we create is selected, we will also automatically add the tag
**building=yes**, and we will create a tag with the key name that the user can
fill in with using a text box.

Now look at the possible tags we have described in the table above.
What is the best way to represent each of these on the form?
For name, we want to create a text box, because the user can fill in any name
that they want for this tag.

For **utility:water**, **utility:phone**, and **utility:internet**, there are
four possible values that the user can select from on our form,
so the best way to add this is with a combo box - that is,
a drop-down menu where the user can select one of the options.
The tag **utility:electrical** only has two possible values, yes or no,
so the best way to show this on our form is with a checkbox,
although we could use a drop-down box if we wanted as well.
When we are finished our form should look like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image97.*
   :align: center

11. Open a text editor and follow along as we create the XML for this preset.
    A simple and common editor to use on Windows is called Notepad.
    DO NOT use a word processing program like Microsoft Word.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image98.*
   :align: center

12. First, we need to create a root element in our XML so that JOSM knows it
    is a presets file.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image99.*
   :align: center

13. Next let’s create an element called <group>.
    This is not actually necessary because we are only creating one preset,
    but it will demonstrate how we can create submenus with many different
    options on our presets menu.
    Don’t forget to add the closing tags **</group>** and **</presets>** to
    your elements.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image100.*
   :align: center

14. Now we can create an item on our menu.
    We want to create an <item> element inside of the group element.
    Add the following text:

::

  <item name="Household">

  </item>

15. Inside the **<item>** element we will add the text box, combo boxes and check
    box that we want on our form.
    Add the following inside your **<item>** element:

::

  <item name="Household">
          <key key="building" value="yes"/>
          <text key="name" text="Name" default="" delete_if_empty="true" />
          <combo key="utility:water" text="Water Access" values="well, municipal, yes, no" default="" delete_if_empty="true" />
          <check key="utility:electrical" text="Electricity Access" />
          <combo key="utility:phone" text="Phone Access" values="landline, mobile, yes, no" display_values="Landline Phone, Mobile Phone, Yes, No" />
          <combo key="utility:internet" text="Internet Access" values="landline, mobile, yes, no" display_values="Landline Access, Mobile Internet Access, Yes, No" />
  </item>

When you are finished your file will look like this:

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image101.*

Much of this is similar to what you saw previously.
Let’s analyse it.
Inside the **<item>** element we have created six more elements:

1. <key>
2. <text>
3. <combo>
4. <check>
5. <combo>
6. <combo>

Can you guess what each of these elements do?
They create different items on our presets form in JOSM.
The first line, **<key key="building" value="yes"/>**,
does not display anything on our form, but tells JOSM to automatically apply
the tag **building=yes** to an object when this preset is selected.

The second line, **<text key="name" text="Name" default=""delete_if_empty="true" />**,
creates a text field with the key name, as we saw when we looked at the
presets XML in the previous section.

We have three **<combo>** elements and each element has several attributes.
key indicates what key should be created for the tag.
Text indicates what text should be displayed on our form.
Values are the possible values that the user can select in the drop-down box.
And we’ve added something new - the attribute **display_values**,
which let’s us show different text in the drop-down boxes than the values that
will be created.
This is useful if we want the form to be more descriptive about the
options a user can select, or if we want the display values to be in a
different language from English.

Lastly, we’ve added one new element, a **checkbox**.
The code for this is simple, **<check key="utility:electrical"text="Electricity Access" />**.
This creates a check box on our form.
When it is selected, JOSM will add a tag to our object that says
**utility:electrical=yes**.

16. Finally, let’s save the XML file so that we can load it into JOSM.
    In Notepad, go to :menuselection:`File ‣ Save`.

17. Type in :kbd:`household_access.xml` as the filename.

18. In the box that says :guilabel:`Save as type:` be sure to select
    :guilabel:`All Files`, because we don’t want to save the file as a text
    document, but rather as an XML document.

19. Click :guilabel:`Save`.


6. Try It!
----------

Now let’s open our presets file in JOSM and see how it looks!

20. Open the Preferences in JOSM and go to :guilabel:`Tagging Presets`, as you 
    did previously.

21. On the right side next to Active presets click on the :guilabel:`+` button.

.. image:: /static/training/old-training/intermediate/osm/image102.*
   :align: center

22. Type :kbd:`Household Presets` into the :guilabel:`Name` field.

23. Next to URL / File, open the xml file that you just created.

24. Click :guilabel:`OK`, and :guilabel:`OK` again to save your preferences.

25. Restart JOSM.

26. Create a new layer and add a point.

27. Go to the Presets menu. You should see the menu that you just created!
