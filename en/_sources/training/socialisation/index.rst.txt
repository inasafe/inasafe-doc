Preface
-------
As one of the most hazard-prone and densely populated countries in the world,
Indonesia faces significant risk of loss of lives and challenges to development
progress as a result of natural disasters. The development of disaster
management plans is seen as an important step to strengthen disaster risk
reduction programs. However, this can only be effective when risk assessments
and contingency planning utilise realistic hazard scenarios.
Realistic hazard scenarios require scientific, sound and up-to-date data hazard
information as well as up-to-date, scale appropriate exposure data.
Such map-based risk assessments and contingency plans contribute to better
disaster management planning and response.
