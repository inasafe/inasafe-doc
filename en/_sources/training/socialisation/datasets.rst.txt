                       modelled on the 30th September 2009 Mw 7.9 earthquake
                       in Padang. ShakeMaps are generated automatically
                       following moderate and large earthquakes by USGS.
                       For more     information go to http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/map/.
                       Pre-event / scenario based shakemaps must be modelled by
                       earthquake specialists.

:Description:         In September 2011, the Indonesian government held a
                      national exercise in Maumere, Flores. |AIFDR| and |GoA|
                      assisted Badan Geology to develop a tsunami model for
                      Maumere based on an Mw 8.1 earthquake. The Tsunami was
                      modelled using open source software called ANUGA and
                      elevation data from NEXTMap. The water depth is the
                      maximum depth occurring across the entire tsunami event.

                          after mapping can change the landslide zone in the map.
                          The high vulnerability zone is to be avoided for
                          settlement areas or strategic infrastructure. If it
                          can't be avoided, build on the moderate zone, but
                          detailed research is needed to avoid landslide happen.
                          In moderate zone, detailed research is also needed
                          when planning to cut the slope.

|GoA| has been working with the Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT) since 2011 
to pilot and train OpenStreetMap data capture in Indonesia.
So far over 12 million buildings have been mapped.
Some of the scenarios we use in the training materials are situated in Jakarta,
Yogyakarta (Merapi), Sumatra (Padang) and Flores (Maumere).

Each one of these areas has a different OpenStreetMap data collection
methodology.
Below the data collection methodologies used in Jakarta and Padang are explained:

:Jakarta: BPBD DKI Jakarta (Regional Disaster Managers) and |BNPB| (National
    Disaster Managers) with assistance from |GoA|, the World Bank,
    UNOCHA, HOT and University of Indonesia, held
    workshops in each of Jakarta's six districts in order to help village heads
    map their community boundaries and major infrastructure.
    Over 500 representatives from Jakarta's 267 villages participated in these
    workshops and have mapped an impressive 6,000 buildings and all 2,668
    sub-village boundaries (Rukun Warga-RW).
    For more information go to `AIFDR Website <http://www.aifdr.org/?p=619>`_

:Padang: After the Haiti earthquake in 2010, there was a large effort to map Haiti
    through OSM. Coordinating this effort was difficult,
    and so |GoA| funded the creation of the OSM Tasking Manager.
    The OSM Tasking Manager is a web-based tool in which a designated area is
    easily divided into a grid, and individual users can select one piece at a time
    to quickly work together and digitally map the target area. The tool was
    first piloted in Padang, where contributors from around the world helped
    digitise over 95,000 buildings. However, the buildings are only footprints - 
    an on the ground mapping effort is needed to record attributes about each building. 
    The tool is now being used across the world to coordinate OSM mapping efforts. 
    It is available at `tasks.hotosm.org <http://tasks.hotosm.org/>`_
