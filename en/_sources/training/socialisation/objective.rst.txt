for QGIS that allows disaster managers to do better planning for disasters.
In this course we explain the conceptual domain - what |project_name| does
(and does not do), why it is important to use a tool such as |project_name|,
what kinds of hazards |project_name| can be used with and so on.
We then delve into the practical side of using |project_name|.
