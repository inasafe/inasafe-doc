|project_name| concepts
========================

In this section we explain the key concepts of |project_name| and explore the
merits of disaster management planning.

How does |project_name| work?
-----------------------------
|project_name| combines one exposure data layer (e.g. location of buildings)
with one hazard scenario (e.g. the footprint of a flood) and returns a
spatial impact layer along with a statistical summary and action questions.
|project_name| is framed around answering questions such as:
*'In the event of a flood similar to the 2013 Jakarta event how many people
might need evacuating.'*

|project_name| is also able to divide the impact results by administrative
boundary and provide a breakdown of information about the gender and age of
affected people.

Definitions:
------------
Before we start, here are some definitions you may find useful.

=========================  ======================================================
**Risk assessment:**       *"A methodology to determine the nature and extent of
                           risk by analysing potential hazards and evaluating
                           existing conditions of vulnerability that together
                           could potentially harm exposed people, property,
                           services, livelihoods and the environment on which
                           they depend. "*
-------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------
**Contingency planning:**  *"A management process that analyses specific
                           potential events or emerging situations that might
                           threaten society or the environment and establishes
                           arrangements in advance to enable timely, effective
                           and appropriate responses to such events and
                           situations."*
-------------------------  ------------------------------------------------------
**Response:**              *"The provision of emergency services and public
                           assistance during or immediately after a disaster in
                           order to save lives, reduce health impacts, ensure
                           public safety and meet the basic subsistence needs
                           of the people affected."*

What is disaster management?
----------------------------
In the context of disaster management, the expected 'normal' situation is that
there is no disaster in progress, and people are going about their normal
daily lives. Disaster managers need to plan for the occasions when the 'normal'
situation has been replaced by a disaster and people can no longer go about
their normal daily lives. In order to prepare for such situations, disaster
managers need to have a basic understanding of questions like:

- how many people might be in the affected area?

- how might those people be impacted?

For example are they likely to be injured, stranded, deceased, or unable to
continue with their normal economic activities;  have they lost access to
food and water?

- how will roads in the affected area be impacted?

- how many dwellings in the affected will be affected? And to what degree?

For example in a flood are buildings dry, wet (but still possibly habitable)
or flooded (with occupants evacuated)?

- if people are affected, how many of them are likely to be women, children, pregnant, elderly etc.?


Knowing the likely answers to these questions can be helpful to disaster
managers. For example if you are aware of how many people live in flood prone
areas you can estimate how many temporary shelters might be needed in the
event of a disaster, how many provisions should be stockpiled in order to
provide for the daily needs of affected people and so on. Having demographic
breakdowns for the people likely to be affected, can help disaster managers
include things like special dietary requirements for lactating women in their
disaster management planning.

This planning might also take into account expected impacts on
infrastructure - for example by planning to have sufficient rescue boats
should all the local roads be flooded.

What is a hazard?
-----------------
.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/004_hazard.*
   :align: center
   :width: 150 pt

In the context of |project_name| a hazard is any natural or human caused event
or series of events that may negatively impact the population, infrastructure
or resources in an area.

Some examples of natural hazards:

- a flood (caused by overflowing rivers, storm surge, localised precipitation that cannot drain effectively, or by engineering failure such as a dam or levee breach)

- an earthquake and the resulting ground shaking that is produced by it

- a volcano eruption and its associated hazards (lava flow, ash fall, lahar, pyroclastic flow)

- a tsunami

Some examples of non-natural hazards:

- a chemical spill

- a nuclear plant failure

- an industrial fire / explosion

It is important to note that |project_name| is not a hazard modelling tool.
That means that you need to obtain your hazard data from elsewhere and bring
it along ready to use in |project_name|. In this training course we will
focus on natural hazards, so we will take a moment here to explain how
hazard datasets might be made.

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/004_jakarta_flood.*
   :align: center
   :width: 400 pt

There are three main ways that can be used to generate hazard datasets:

- Local knowledge

- Modelling

- Mapping

Local knowledge
...............

This is probably the most practical way to gather hazard data quickly.
One approach that has been effective in Indonesia is to hold mapping
workshops where village chiefs and local officials are invited. The officials
are asked to indicate which villages and sub-villages within their area of
responsibility flood regularly.

Instead of simply mapping which areas are flooded, it is also possible to
take another approach and map each flood event, using the same boundaries
(village / sub-village). During the event community officials can use online
systems to update the status of the flood waters in their area.

A key requirement for any local knowledge based process is that there are
suitable mapping units available to use for deciding if an area is flood
prone or not. In some cases participants may need to capture these, in other
cases village or sub-village boundaries can be used. Using administrative
boundaries may not always be ideal since the flood extents are unlikely to
align well with the boundaries, but it may be sufficient for broad
planning purposes; especially when response activities are managed at the
same administrative level.

Modelling
.........

Modelling floods is an entire discipline in its own right. Flood modelling
can be carried out by combining factors such as precipitation, geology and
runoff characteristics, terrain etc. to derive a model of impending or
current flood. Modelling can use data interpolation techniques - e.g. by
taking flood depth readings manually or using telemetry from various sites
around the flood prone area, flood depths can be interpolated to estimate
the depth at places that were not sampled.

Another modelling approach used by engineers is to install depth sensors
upstream of the catchment and then try to model how much water is coming into
the catchment area based on depth and flow rates. This has the potential
advantage of giving early warning before floods enter the flood prone area,
although it also has the disadvantage that localised rainfall may not be
accurately considered in the model.

Using a digital elevation model (DEM) and a stream network, it is also
possible to generate a simple model of which areas might be inundated by a
water rise in the river network of a certain amount. DEM cells adjacent to
the stream network which are below the flood-rise threshold will be
considered flooded and then those cell neighbours can in turn be considered
so as to ensure that only contiguous areas in the DEM are flagged as inundated.
There are various other approaches that can be used to model flood potential
that involve using a DEM.

One advantage of using a modelling approach is that it allows us to forecast
less frequent events. For example, there may not be localised knowledge about
1 in 50 or 100 year flood events and their impacts, but these can be estimated
using modelling techniques.

Single-event versus multiple-event hazards
------------------------------------------
Hazard data used in |project_name| can represent either single-event or
multiple-event. Single event hazards are useful when you want to estimate
scenarios like *'how many people would be affected if we had another flood
like in 2013'.*  A single event hazard covers a short span of time - like a
single flood or earthquake event. Single event data is also the most suitable
to use for events which are stochastic e.g. earthquakes which seldom occur
at the same place and with the same intensity more than once.

Multiple-event data are useful when you would like to plan for disasters
that repeatedly affect the same area. For example over the course of 10 years,
the same districts or sub-districts may get flooded, though not on every event.
Flood and volcano eruptions may be good candidates for using multiple-event
data in your disaster management planning.

What is exposure?
-----------------
.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/004_exposure.*
   :align: center
   :width: 200 pt

In the context of |project_name|, exposure refers to people, infrastructure
or land areas that may be affected by a disaster. Currently |project_name|
supports four kinds of exposure data:

- roads

- buildings

- population / people

- landcover


Roads data
..........

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/icon_road.*
   :align: left
   :width: 150 pt

Road datasets are a useful data source when you want to understand the impact
of a flood on roads infrastructure. With the |project_name| flood on roads
impact functions; you can calculate which roads of which type might be
impacted by a flood.

Very often there will be national datasets available for roads.  In this case
you should contact your national mapping agency for up-to-date datasets.
The OpenStreetMap project is an excellent source of exposure data. The data
is freely available, generally well maintained and a vital resource for
disaster management planners. There are numerous ways to download
OpenStreetMap roads data, but our recommended way is to download the data
using the OSM download tool provided with |project_name|.

Buildings (structure) data
..........................

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/icon_building.*
   :align: left
   :width: 150 pt

Like roads, building footprints can be a useful dataset to have for
understanding the impacts of a flood. For example you may wish to know
'how many buildings might be flooded, and what types of buildings are they?'.
In |project_name|  you do not need to use engineering quality data.
We are more concerned with the numbers and types of structures affected by a
disaster and do not work at engineering tolerances needed when, for example,
planning a new water mains system.

Population data
...............
.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/icon_people.*
   :align: left
   :width: 150 pt

Population data can often be obtained from your census bureau or through
various online data sources. One problem with population data is that it is
often quite coarse (represented using a raster with a large pixel size) and
so analysis at large scales (e.g. a small neighbourhood) using population
data may not always be the best idea. Currently |project_name|  only supports
raster based census data, but in the near future we will be releasing a
version that supports assigning population estimates to buildings using
census data. One of the best online resources for population data is
'WorldPop' - a project that aims to provide population data for anywhere
in the globe produced in a standardised and rigorous way.

Landcover data can often be obtained from national mapping agencies or through
various online data sources. Landcover data are useful if you want to assess
the impact of a hazard event such as a volcanic eruption on crops.

various online data sources. Places data are useful if you want to assess
the impact of a hazard event such as a volcanic ash event on place.

What is aggregation?
--------------------
Aggregation is the process whereby we group the results of the analysis by
district so that you can see how many people, roads or buildings were
affected in each area. This will help you to understand where the most
critical needs are, and to generate reports as shown in the image below.
Aggregation is optional in |project_name| - if you do not use aggregation,
the entire analysis area will be used for the data summaries.
Typically aggregation layers in |project_name| have as attributes the name
of the district or reporting area. It is also possible to use extended
attributes to indicate the ratio of men and women; youth, adults and
elderly living in each area. Where these are provided and the exposure layer
is population, |project_name| will provide a demographic breakdown per
aggregation area indicating how many men, women etc were probably affected
in that area.

   :width: 400 pt

What is contextual data?
------------------------

Contextual data are data that provide a sense of place and scale when
preparing or viewing the results of analysis, while not actually being used
for the analysis. For example you may include online maps to show the
underlying relief of the study area, or an aerial image to show what
buildings and infrastructure exist in the area.

What is the difference between raster and vector data?
------------------------------------------------------
Vector data is arguably the most common kind of data you will find in the
daily use of GIS. It describes geographic data in terms of points that may be
connected into lines and polygons. Every object in a vector dataset is called
a feature, and is associated with data that describes that feature. The basic
shape of objects stored in the vector data is defined with a two-dimensional
coordinate system / Cartesian (x, y).

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/004_vector.*
   :align: center
   :width: 250 pt

Raster data is different from vector data. While vector data has discrete
features constructed out of vertices, and perhaps connected with lines
and/or areas; raster data, is like an image. Although it may portray various
properties of objects in the real world, these objects don't exist as separate
objects; rather, they are represented using pixels or cells of various
different numerical values. These values can be real and represent different
characteristics of the geography, such as water depth or amount of volcanic
ash; or they can be a code than is related to the type of land use or the
hazard class.

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/004_raster.*
   :align: center
   :width: 150 pt

.. note:: Creating vector data is like using a pen, where you can draw a point,
          a line or a polygon, Raster data is like taking a picture with a
          camera, where each square has one value, and all the squares (pixels)
          combine to make a picture.

Both vector and raster data can be used in |project_name|. For example, we use
vector data for the extent of a flood hazard and as well as roads and
building footprint; but we use raster data for modelled hazards such as
flood depth, tsunami inundation and for population exposure.

What is the difference between continuous and classified data?
--------------------------------------------------------------

In |project_name| we differentiate between data which is continuous and data
which is classified. The terms can be applied equally to both hazard and
exposure data. **Continuous** data represent a **continuously varying
phenomenon** such as depth in meters, population counts and so on.

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/004_raster_continuous.*
   :align: center
   :width: 500 pt

**Classified** data represent **named groups of values**, for example, high,
medium and low hazard. Grouping values works well when you wish to reduce data
preparation complexity or deal with local variances in the interpretation of
data. For example, a flood depth of 50cm may represent a high hazard zone
in an area where people commonly have basements in their houses, and a low
hazard zone in areas where people commonly build their houses on raised
platforms.

What is the analysis extent?
----------------------------

In |project_name|  you need to explicitly state what the intended analysis
extent should be. In other words, you need to tell InaSAFE where the analysis
should be carried out. There is a tool in InaSAFE that will allow you to drag
a box around the intended analysis area - you should always check that you
have done this before starting your analysis.

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/004_analysis_extent.*
   :align: center
   :width: 350 pt
   :alt: Analysis extent in |project_name|

|project_name| will show you what your current desired analysis extent is
(blue line in green box), what the extent of your last analysis was
(red box in the image above) and what your effective extent is
(green box in the image above). The effective extent may not correspond
exactly to your desired analysis extent because |project_name| always aligns
the extent to the edge of raster pixels.

What is an Impact Function?
---------------------------

.. image:: /static/training/socialisation/004_impact_function.*
   :align: center
   :width: 300 pt

An Impact Function (often abbreviated to IF) is software code in
|project_name| that implements a particular algorithm to determine the
impact of a hazard on the selected exposure. Running an impact function
is done when you have prepared all your input data, defined your analysis
extent and wish to now see the impact outputs.

Again, we should emphasise here that Impact Functions **do not model hazards**
- they **model the effects** of one or more hazard events on an exposure layer.
|project_name| groups its impact functions according to the kind of hazard
they work on:

Each Impact Function will generate outputs that may include:
- an impact map layer
- an impact summary
- minimum needs
- action checklists

What is an impact layer?
------------------------
An impact layer is a new GIS dataset that is produced as the result of
running an impact function. It will usually represent the exposure layer.
For example, if you do a flood  analysis on buildings, the impact layer
produced will be a buildings layer but each building will be classified
according to whether it is dry, wet or flooded. |project_name| will typically
apply its own symbology to the output impact layer to make it clear which
are the impacted buildings. This is illustrated in the image below.

It should also be noted that the impact layer will only include features /
cells that occur within the analysis extent. All others will be 'clipped away'.
It is very important to remember this when interpreting the map legend and the
impact summary (see section below) because they are only relevant to the
analysis area.  The impact layer is not saved by default. If you want to
save this spatial data you need to do this yourself.

   :width: 300 pt

What is the impact summary?
---------------------------
Whereas the impact layer represents spatial data, the impact summary is
tabular and textual data. The impact summary provides a table (or series of
tables) and other textual information with the numbers of buildings, roads or
people affected, and includes other useful information such as minimum needs
breakdowns, action checklists and summaries. The impact summary presents the
results of the impact function in an easy to digest form. Our expectation that
the numbers show here would form part of the input to your emergency
management planning process - typically as a launch point for discussion and
planning on how to have sufficient resources in order to cater for the
impacted people, buildings or roads should a similar event to the one on
which the scenario is based occur.
An example of an impact summary is shown below.

What are minimum needs?
-----------------------
Minimum needs are a population specific reporting component for the
impact summary. They are based on generic or regional preferences and define
the daily food and well-being requirements for each individual who may be
displaced during a disaster. For example you could specify that each person
should receive 20l of fresh drinking water per day, 50l of bathing water and
so on. |project_name| will calculate these numbers to provide an estimate of
the total needs for the displaced population.

What are action checklists?
---------------------------
Action checklists are generated lists of things disaster managers should
consider when implementing their disaster management plan. Currently the
action checklists are fairly simplistic - they are intended to prompt
discussion and stimulate disaster managers to think about the important
contingencies they should have in place.
