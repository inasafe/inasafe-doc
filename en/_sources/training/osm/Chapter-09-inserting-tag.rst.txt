Chapter 9: Inserting Special Tag in JOSM
========================================

**Learning Objectives**

-  Be able to insert tag in iD Editor
-  Be able to insert tag in JOSM
-  Understanding standard tags that are used in OpenStreetMap

You understand how to add data in OpenStreetMap and how to maintain the quality of existing data so that 
we can contribute better. In this training we want the objects that we mapped in OpenStreetMap to also appear 
as an article in Wikipedia. Therefore we need to insert some special tags so that later, articles based on 
mapped objects, can be uniformly displayed and in accordance with applicable rules.

9.1 Inserting Tag in iD Editor
------------------------------

When we want to add special tags in iD Editor we must ensure that we are connected to the Internet. 
Here are the steps for inserting a tag in iD Editor.

1. Open the site: `www.openstreetmap.org <http://www.openstreetmap.org>`_

2. :guilabel:`Sign in` with your OSM account

3. Select edit with :guilabel:`iD Editor`

4. Select object that you want to add the tag

.. figure:: /static/training/osm/9_001.*
   :align: center

   *Display of tag in iD Editor*

5. Then select :guilabel:`All tags` and click :guilabel:`+` and add tag that you want.

   *Tag box in iD Editor*

6. After that, letâ€™s :guilabel:`Save` your changes.

9.2 Inserting Tag in JOSM
--------------------------

Besides inserting a special tag to the object using iD Editor we can also insert the tags to objects using JOSM. 
Basically inserting tags in JOSM almost equal to iD Editor. Here are the steps:

1. Open JOSM in your computer/laptop

2. Download area you want to edit

3. **Select the object** you want to add tags

4. Then click :guilabel:`Add` on properties box on the right side as shown in the figure below

.. figure:: /static/training/osm/9_003.*
   :align: center

   *Adding tag in JOSM*

5. Type the **tag** that you want to use as shown in the figure below:

.. figure:: /static/training/osm/9_004.*
   :align: center

   *Adding key and value box*

6. Then click :guilabel:`OK`

9.3 Presets Standardization
---------------------------
OpenStreetMap allows all users to provide as many details as they can about their map. This information can 
be imprinted on each object using the menu presets available on OSM editor. We often find inconsistencies
in the provision of information on various objects. Therefore the presets help standardization and uniformity of data.

Menu Presets are made for these purposes:

1. To ensure the stability (consistency) of data

2. To facilitate the search and processing data

3. As a benchmark in the provision of information through the presets

4. As a reference if you want to make improvements or validate the data

5. Maximizing the use of existing Internal Presets in JOSM

6. Maximizing data visualization on OpenStreetMap website

By using presets, standardization is enforced for all OSM users that use the standard menu preset when editing 
the map. One of the advantages of using internal presets that are already available in JOSM is 
the object visualization will render correctly on the OSM website.

   *Amenities list in Wiki OSM*


Here are some informations that you should put into this project:

**Building**

-  Building name (key : name)
-  Ownership (key : operator)
-  Building type (key : amenity)
-  Building level (key : building:levels)
-  Address (key : addr:full)
-  Reference (key : source:ref)

**Highway**

-  Highway name (key : name)
-  Ownership (key : operator)
-  Highway type (key : highway)
-  Reference (key : source:ref)
-  Highway width (key : width)
