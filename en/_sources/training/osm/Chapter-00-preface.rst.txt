The Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (|AIFDR|) is a joint

Australian and Indonesian governments at a special ceremony on 15 July 2010
launched the Australia-Indonesia facility. The launch marks an important

Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work,
especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out-of-date,
or rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap (OSM) is a web project to create a free and
open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with
GPS, digitising aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing
public sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (|HOT|)
is an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and
open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development.

Preface
-------
Every day thousands of people contribute to OSM,
a project with the lofty goal of mapping the world. Most OSM software is
free and open source, and the data is open for anyone to use. The idea is
simple: if you make a map of your town and we make a map of ours,
we can share those maps on a common platform. With enough people
contributing, we can collect data throughout the world.

Collecting Spatial Data using OpenStreetMap is a step-by-step course
designed to help anyone get started with OSM. While it might seem daunting 
at first, OSM is simple enough that anyone can get started creating maps,
and as your understanding grows you'll find that you can do more and more
interesting things.

This tutorial makes few assumptions. It assumes you have used a computer
before, and that you have an email address. If you don't have an email
address, we suggest you have a friend help you sign up for one. There are
many websites where you can get a free email address, such as www.gmail.com
or mail.yahoo.com.

The only other assumption is that you've used the internet before. Perhaps
you're familiar with Facebook or email, and that's certainly enough to get
started with OSM. If you're already comfortable using a computer
and surfing the web, don't worry – this guide is for you too. No matter your
proficiency, we'll take you step-by-step through OSM and you'll be mapping
in no time!
