About Toolkit
-------------

**The Beginning OpenStreetMap Trainer Toolkit** is designed to prepare
trainers to deliver an introductory training course to new users of OSM.
The materials included will prepare trainers to conduct trainings with a
variety of audiences and to cover common problems and pitfalls,
and also provide trainers with the best methodologies to engage new mappers.

When organising an OpenStreetMap workshop, numerous factors must be
considered, including the length of time you have to train,
available resources, number of trainees and their technical skills.
This toolkit will help trainers prepare trainings for different types of
participants, but it will primarily focus on educating those with little or
no experience with GPS, map-making and computers.

The purpose of this toolkit is to prepare the trainer to successfully train
workshop participants in adding spatial data to OpenStreetMap.

Purpose of Workshop
...................
This workshop is intended to achieve the following standard and basic 
competencies:

Standard Competency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Collecting Spatial Data with OSM

Basic Competencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Draw paper maps to gain a basic understanding of OpenStreetMap                                          
2. Navigate OpenStreetMap website                                                                          
3. Operate JOSM                                                                                            
4. Use GPS to add data to OSM                                                                              
5. Use Field Papers to add data to OSM                                                                     
6. Edit a map and add information to OSM using JOSM                                                        
7. Correct imagery offset                                                                                  
8. Get OSM data in a specific format to be analysed further in Geographic Information System (GIS) software

Workshop Materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. The OpenStreetMap website
2. Working with OSM
3. Working with JOSM
4. Using GPS
5. Field Papers
6. Editing OpenStreetMap through JOSM
7. Imagery offset
8. Getting OSM data

Workshop Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Methods emphasised in this workshop are participatory teaching
   and active participation in all sections and
   activities, rather than lecture method.
2. **Participant oriented.**
   Participants are encouraged to find and gain knowledge and skills
   by themselves.
3. **Trainers serve as facilitators.**
   Trainers facilitate to help ideas in the workshop emerge
   from the participants, not only from trainers.
   However, trainers must be ready to provide necessary information
   when the participants need any assistance.
4. **Outcome oriented.** Workshop must produce the outcomes mentioned 
   previously.

Tools
^^^^^

1. Copy of :ref:`Data Collection Using OpenStreetMap Beginner Level <begin-osm>` 
   for participants
2. A workshop space with tables and seats
3. Computers (one computer may be used by two participants,
   but it is better if one computer is used by one participant)
4. A Printer (to print out Field Papers)
5. A Projector (to present slide and demonstrate technical instructions and
   software)
6. GPS devices (ideally, one GPS is used by two or three participants in
   a group)
7. Batteries for GPS devices
8. USB cable to connect GPS devices to computer
9. USB Flash drive(s) to transfer files and software
10. Good internet connection
11. Snacks and coffee for breaks

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**How did the UK begin mapping? How did OpenStreetMap start?**

OpenStreetMap started with just a handful of volunteers who had GPS devices.
They went out, collected data on their GPS and made sketches of maps and
took notes, and then added the data into the OSM database at home.
These initial volunteers hosted "Mapping Parties" in different towns,
in which anybody could come out with them one day and go mapping.
These parties helped expand the network of volunteers,
get more people involved, and create great maps of different towns.

**How did they create maps so thoroughly? What technologies did they use?**

At the beginning, mappers only had GPS to work with, and any map data that
was freely given to the OpenStreetMap community.
Later, OSM made a deal with Yahoo! to be able to use their satellite
imagery to digitise maps with.
More recently, Microsoft and Mapbox have made imagery available to OSM.

**Can we use OSM with Google Maps?**

It is not legal to use Google Maps as a resource when editing
OpenStreetMap.
Google has not given permission for this like Microsoft has,
and so it is not acceptable to use.

**Forgot Password**

Sometimes participants forget their password.
In this case, you will need to help them to reset or create a new password.
If that is not possible they may need to open a new email account.
If the participants already have an OpenStreetMap account but forget the
password, help them to reset their password.

**Do not have email**

If participants do not have an email account, help them create a new
one.

Common Problems
***************

**Setting up on Mac and Ubuntu**

The steps to install on Mac and Ubuntu are quite easy.
JOSM is a software based on Java so it is platform independent,
but you have to make sure Java is already installed on your computer
system.
GPSBabel does not have a GUI for Linux, so it would be harder to use on Linux,
especially for newbie users.

**JOSM runs out of memory**

Sometimes if someone downloads a lot of imagery and data on JOSM,
the computer runs out of memory and crashes.
The solution is to start JOSM with a batch file that will tell JOSM to add extra
memory.
An example batch file is provide in this toolkit, but you have to edit it
using a text editor to put the correct location of the josm.jar file.

**Participants add tags on nodes rather than the ways**

Sometimes it is difficult for new OSM users to understand that a way consists of
several nodes. Often a tag that is supposed to be put on a way is accidentally
put on the nodes that make up that way.
This can happen when a user draws a selection box that selects all the nodes on
an object. This is an important problem to correct from the beginning, to
train good mappers.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**Is there an easy way to restart JOSM after we finish installing plugins?**

Yes, there is a plugin that you can add which allow you to restart JOSM by
clicking a button.
To activate it, install it in the Preferences menu.

**Could we make tags in Bahasa Indonesia?**

Theoretically, you can add any tag to nodes, ways or shapes on OSM.
But because all of the objects on OSM are saved in international databases
and cover the whole world, we need a consensus about how to make a tag.
As an example, a hospital is still a hospital in England, France and
even in Indonesia.
If every country gives a tag with their own language it will be difficult and
confusing to show the icon or symbol for different locations.
Because OSM originated in England and English is a very common language
all over the world, the English language is the language which is accepted for
tagging in OpenStreetMap.
However if you want to alter the presets menu to use your own language it is
still possible.

**Can we change the colour of nodes and ways and can we change the icons? How 
can we print?**

You can change the colour of the objects in the Preferences menu.
This is very useful especially when it is hard to see nodes on ways and
shapes against a background.
When participants ask about how to change the symbol or show the name of
objects, you need to tell them that this program is for editing data and
not to see the preview or result and print a map.
All of the nodes and tags will be saved in a database, but you can use some other
software to render your map to look better.
For example, the map on openstreetmap.org is rendered, although there are many
more examples.
The difference between editing data and rendering on another software might
be quite hard to understand by participants in the beginning.

**What is the difference between presets and tags?**

A tag is a piece of information that you attach to nodes,
ways or shapes (polygon) to describe one of the attributes.
Presets are a menu that simplifies the task of applying tags to an object.

Common Problems
***************

**Make sure you have batteries and extra USB cables**

GPS devices burn through batteries relatively quickly, so it is a good idea to
make sure every group has extra batteries when they go out mapping.
Then when they return, they will need to move the data from GPS to the computer.
It is best if every group has its own USB cable, which will enable
faster copying of data to the computers.

**All GPSes should be formatted the same**

Before the training, make sure all GPS devices are formatted in the same way,
which will prevent participants from getting confused. Many GPS settings can
be changed, but when teaching a group it is best if they all look the same.

The key things to make sure of are that:

- Page arrangement is same and in the same order: Main Menu, Track page, Map
  page, Satellite page
- Coordinates are saved in decimal degrees
- Units are in metres
- Elevation has been calibrated correctly

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**What projection does the GPS use for collected data?**

A GPS can be set to record in different projections, but for our needs,
the GPS must be set to record coordinates in geographic projection WGS84 
(EPSG:4326).

**How accurate is the GPS? How can the accuracy affect the data?**

Consumer-grade GPS devices (such as the Garmin eTrex line) typically have an
accuracy of between three and 15 metres.
The Satellite page on the GPS indicates the accuracy when it is in use.
For our mapping needs, inaccuracy less than 15 metres can be ignored.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**How can we print large size maps, such as a poster for a community mapping project?**

One way of doing this is by using |QGIS|, though the topic is not covered
during this session. Basic QGIS training is provided in the next unit of
this training, and from there users may be able to learn how to format and
print large maps.

**How do we scan Field Papers?**

You can use a scanner, a mobile (smartphone) or a camera to take photos of
Field Papers and then upload them to fieldpapers.org.

**What should we do if uploading Field Papers is really slow or does not work at all?**

Unfortunately, the Field Papers website is not always 100% working, especially
when many people are using it as once. The process of uploading may take longer
than your lunch break. If this becomes a problem during training, participants
may simply use their Field Papers as handheld notes and you may show them how
to use imagery and GPS data as reference layers.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**Should we use a point or a polygon to identify a restaurant in a mall?**

You should use a point.
Polygons are used if you clearly know the shape of a building or area.
If you want to identify a landmark inside a larger polygon,
such as a building it is better to use a point.

**How do we map a bridge in JOSM?**

To mark a bridge, you need to split the lines which marks the bridge (usually
a way) on both sides of the bridge.
If you have a road that crosses a river, you can click on the dots on the
side of the river and press 'P' on the keyboard to split the line at that
point.
Then the selected line can be tagged as bridge using the presets menu.

**How do we digitise a building to have a perfect rectangle shape?**

It is not easy to make a perfect rectangle only using your hand.
Luckily there are tools that can make the proper angle at each corner of a
polygon.
Select the polygon (building) and press :kbd:`Q` on the keyboard to shape
that polygon.

**The map on OpenStreetMap does not show edits immediately. What can we do?**

Usually it will take about 5-10 minutes to see your changes appear
on the OpenStreetMap website.
If you can not see the changes on OpenStreetmap after that time it may be 
because your browser is still caching the old map.
In this case you should reload the page in your browser.
If this is not successful you may need to delete the cache in your browser.
For example, in Google Chrome go to :menuselection:`Tools ‣ Clear Browsing Data`.
Click :guilabel:`Empty the cache` and click :guilabel:`Clear browsing data`.
Then refresh the page again and your edits should appear.
Sometimes it still can take a while until changes to OpenStreetMap appear on
the main page.

Common Problems
***************

**HOT Exports takes a long time to process a job**

The HOT Export server uses a first come - first serve strategy.
That means the server serves the user who executes the first data request
first. The size of the desired area also affects the processing time.
The greater the total area the longer the process will take.
