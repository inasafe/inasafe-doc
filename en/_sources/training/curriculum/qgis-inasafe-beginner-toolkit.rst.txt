About Toolkit
-------------

**The Beginning QGIS-** |project_name| **Toolkit** is designed to prepare
trainers to deliver training for new QGIS users.
The materials included will prepare trainers to conduct trainings with a
variety of audiences and to cover common problems and pitfalls,
and also provide trainers with the best methodologies.

When organising a QGIS-|project_name| training, numerous factors must be
considered, including the length of time you have to train,
available resources, number of trainees and their technical skills.
This toolkit will help trainers prepare trainings for different types of
participants, but it will primarily focus on educating those with little or
no experience with GPS, map-making and computers.

The purpose of this toolkit is to prepare the trainer to successfully train
workshop participants in using QGIS and analysing hazard and exposure data with
|project_name|.

Purpose of Workshop

Workshop Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Methods emphasised in this workshop are participatory teaching
   and active participation in all sections and
   activities, rather than lecture method.
2. **Participant oriented.**
   Participants are encouraged to find and gain knowledge and skills
   by themselves.
3. **Trainers serve as facilitators.**
   Trainers facilitate to help ideas in the workshop emerge
   from the participants, not only from trainers.
   However, trainers must be ready to provide necessary information
   when the participants need any assistance.
4. **Outcome oriented.** Workshop must produce the outcomes mentioned 
   previously.

Tools
^^^^^
1. Copy of :ref:`Data Analysis using QGIS and InaSAFE Beginner 
   Level <begin-qgis-inasafe>` for participants
2. A workshop space with tables and seats
3. Computers (one computer may be used by two participants,
   but it is better if one computer is used by one participant)
4. A Projector (to present slide and demonstrate technical instructions and
   software)
5. USB Flash drive(s) to transfer files and software
6. Good internet connection
7. Snacks and coffee for breaks

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**What should we do if the plugin installation fails?**

This can be caused by a poor internet connection. An internet connection is 
needed during plugin installation, especially if the plugin file is big like
|project_name|.
If this is a major problem, it can be addressed by preparing the plugin file 
on a flash drive.
Then copy the plugin to :file:`C:\Users\Computer\.qgis\python\plugins`.

**What if the Fetch Python Plugin menu is not available?**

Open the settings from the *fetch python plugin*
options menu.
Tick the box next to *check for updates* on startup which should add a list of new
plugins automatically.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**When adding vector data, why doesn't my vector data show up in the Open dialog?**

Sometimes participants find it difficult to distinguish between the buttons to
open vector data and raster data (because they are next to one another).
Make sure participants click the correct button.

**When adding vector data, why is there some data that does not appear on**
**the QGIS display?**

Check the order of the data layers in the Layers panel. Polygons should be 
at the bottom, followed by the lines, then the points at the top. Often one 
layer may overlap another layer.

**Sometimes when using the Identify tool, the attribute window does not appear
when we click on an object. Why?**

Check that the vector data layer is selected in the Layers panel before clicking
on objects to identify.

|    in QGIS. Remember when showing                                 |               | containing    |
|    raster and vector data at the same time the vector layers      |               | vector data   |
|    should be above the raster data to be visible.                 |               |               |
| 3. Change the raster symbology                                    |               | Module 8      |
|    to make it more easily understood.                             |               |               |
|    Make the symbology as in the module text. If you               |               |               |
|    want to change the symbology of raster data it                 |               |               |
|    will be better if the raster data has been given               |               |               |
|    symbology before.                                              |               |               |
| 4. Do terrain analysis and create a hillshade.                    |               |               |

|    QGIS can also be used to digitise data. However,               |               | Computer      |
|    explain that the weakness of digitising through                |               |               |
|    QGIS is that data is more difficult to share, unlike OSM.      |               | Module 9      |
| 2. Explain also that things that can not be digitised in          |               |               |
|    OSM can be digitised in QGIS, such as flood-                   |               |               |
|    prone areas or KRB areas. Vector data like this                |               |               |

| 4. After that, participants may be asked whether they             |               |               |
|    can digitise a map with image formats such as                  |               |               |

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**Why does my buffer result look bigger than the one shown in the example?**

This happens because of the projection.
It just looks different because of the projection, but it is the same size 
in reality.

**Why doesn't the query builder result show up?**

This is usually because of incorrect input into the query builder.
Watch carefully what you input into the query builder.

| 1. In this session you will be explain how to make                | Practice      |               |
|    maps that are ready to be printed using                        |               | Projector     |
|    QGIS. First, you need to explain that it is                    |               |               |
|    important to change the projection system into                 |               | Module 11     |
|    mercator projection system (Universal Transverse               |               |               |
|    Mercator/UTM) and ask participants to change                   |               |               |
|    all of the data projections into the same projection system.   |               |               |
| 2. Ask what are the basic elements that should be put into a      |               |               |
|    map and show some                                              |               |               |
|    examples of good maps and bad maps. You should                 |               |               |
|    emphasise the basic elements of maps to the participants.      |               |               |
| 3. Explain the interface of the                                   |               |               |
|    Map Composer in QGIS. Explain the                              |               |               |
|    functions of the toolbars and then practice                    |               |               |
|    inputting the data into the composer page, and adjust          |               |               |
|    the scale so all of the data that needs to be shown            |               |               |
|    can be seen. Then add a map title.                             |               |               |
| 4. Add the compass rose and scale bar                             |               |               |
|    into the map. Explain                                          |               |               |
|    that there are two types of scale, numerical and               |               |               |
|    graphical. The numeric scale uses numbers to                   |               |               |
|    symbolise real distances. The                                  |               |               |
|    graphical scale uses a scale bar to compare distance.          |               |               |
| 5. The next elements that need to be added to the map             |               |               |
|    are a legend, inset and grid. Explain why those                |               |               |
|    elements are important. The legend needs to be                 |               |               |
|    shown because it help the map user understand                  |               |               |
|    the symbols contained in the map. Inset needs to be            |               |               |
|    shown to show the location of the map from the                 |               |               |
|    smaller scale (for example 1:500.000 or                        |               |               |
|    1:5000.000). A grid makes it easier for us to                  |               |               |
|    determine the location through coordinates.                    |               |               |
| 6. After finishing the map, tell participants to save             |               |               |
|    the print composer and about the                               |               |               |
|    formats that they can use in the print composer,               |               |               |
|    such as .pdf, .jpeg and .svg, using the export feature.        |               |               |

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**I put the correct numbers in the x and y intervals in the grid dialog,**
**but why does the grid not show up?**

This can occur because the map may still be using geographic projection 
(WGS 84), which is in decimal degrees. To make the x and y intervals, it
is better to use the mercator projection system so that they intervals
are in metres.
