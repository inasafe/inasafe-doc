Intermediate OpenStreetMap Trainer's Toolkit - (A Guide for Facilitators)

About Toolkit
-------------

**The Intermediate OpenStreetMap Trainer Toolkit** is designed to prepare
trainers to deliver an intermediate training course to users of OSM.
The materials included are designed to continue from the 
**Beginner OpenStreetMap Training**.

When organising an OpenStreetMap workshop, numerous factors must be
considered, including the length of time you have to train,
available resources, number of trainees and their technical skills.
This toolkit will help trainers prepare trainings for different types of
participants, but it will primarily focus on educating those with little or
no experience with GPS, map-making and computers. Participants of this
training should have experience already working with OSM.

The purpose of this toolkit is to prepare the trainer to successfully train
workshop participants in adding spatial data to OpenStreetMap.

Purpose of Workshop
...................
This workshop is intended to achieve the following standard and basic 
competencies:

Standard Competency
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Quality Assurance in OSM mapping

Basic Competencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Apply better digitising techniques for improving quality of collected data  
2. Use JOSM validation tools to ensure the quality of map contributions        
3. Resolve conflicts when uploading OSM data                                   
4. Create presets files in JOSM                                                
5. Use private data store feature to keep private data                         
6. Create and edit pages in OSM Wiki                                           

Workshop Materials
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Advanced Editing
2. Quality Assurance
3. Dealing with Conflicts
4. Creating JOSM File Presets
5. Using the Separate Data Store
6. Editing the OpenStreetMap Wiki

Workshop Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
1. Methods emphasised in this workshop are participatory teaching
   and active participation in all sections and
   activities, rather than lecture method.
2. **Participant oriented.**
   Participants are encouraged to find and gain knowledge and skills
   by themselves.
3. **Trainers serve as facilitators.**
   Trainers facilitate to help ideas in the workshop emerge
   from the participants, not only from trainers.
   However, trainers must be ready to provide necessary information
   when the participants need any assistance.
4. **Outcome oriented.** Workshop must produce the outcomes mentioned 
   previously.

Tools
^^^^^
1. Copy of :ref:`Data Collection Using OSM Intermediate Guide <interm-osm>` 
   for participants
2. A workshop space with tables and seats
3. Computers (one computer may be used by two participants,
   but it is better if one computer is used by one participant)
4. A Projector (to present slide and demonstrate technical instructions and
   software)
5. USB Flash drive(s) to transfer files and software
6. Good internet connection
7. Snacks and coffee for breaks

| 1. Request participants to discuss what they have                 | Q & A Session | Microphone    |
|    done with OpenStreetMap (OSM) since                            | Lecture       | Speakers      |
|    the first workshop (beginner training)                         |               | Projector     |
| 2. Create a questions list from participants, showing them all    |               |               |
|    on the projector.                                              |               |               |

|    But if the questions are outside workshop material,            |               |               |
|    give the other references                                      |               |               |

|    for example at lunch break.                                    |               |               |
| 4. Explain what participants will get from this workshop          |               |               |
|    (intermediate workshop). Separate participants into two sides, |               |               |
|    asking more details about their experience using               |               |               |
|    computers and OSM. Pair the participants so that there is      |               |               |
|    a good balance of skill in each pair. Less experienced         |               |               |
|    participants should be paired with more advanced users.        |               |               |

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**I have set the building size in the building tools plugin. Why do buildings
show as a line, not as a polygon?**

It may look this way if you are not zoomed in far enough. Zoom in further
to see the building properly.

**I want to create a circle. Why do I get a very large circle with the
'create a circle' tool in utilsplugins2?**

Before using this tool, first create a way with exactly two nodes. If you
create a way with more than two nodes, the resulting circle made from this
tool can end up very large.

FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions)
********************************

**How do we avoid conflicts?**

If you are working with other mappers, divide the work area so that your
efforts do not overlap.

It is also wise to upload your edits regularly. Fewer conflicts will occur
if you upload changes soon after downloading data.

**What is the meaning of the green, yellow and red colours in the conflict 
dialog?**

The green colour means that the nodes are also in the OSM server and in the
same order.
The yellow colour means that the nodes are also in the OSM server but not the
same order.
The red colour means that the nodes exist just in one version,
whether it is the working version or on the OSM server.

| 1. Add presets through the "Preferences" menu.                    | Practice      |               |
| 2. If participants get an error after adding their presets file   |               |               |
|    into JOSM, help them correct it.                               |               |               |
|    Usually errors happen when participants make mistakes          |               |               |
|    with their XML.                                                |               |               |
|    Make sure participants are able to succesfully correct and     |               |               |
|    add into JOSM. Then practise tagging objects with the new      |               |               |
|    menu.                                                          |               |               |

| Discuss the session. Explain how the SDS can be set up privately  |               |               |
| for organisations and users that want to maintain their own       |               |               |
| private data store.                                               |               |               |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------+---------------+---------------+

Common Problems
***************

**Internet connection**

Sometimes the demo SDS has problems when many people are using it
because of limited bandwidth. You may need to ask participants to
watch demonstration rather than practising all on their own.

| 2. Tell participants that they should sign up with the same       |               | connected     |
|    name (account), because it will help them remember their       |               | internet      |
|    login info (which often confuses users and prevents            |               | Module 6      |
|    them from logging in) and it makes it easier for               |               |               |
|    other users to find them both on OSM and the wiki.             |               |               |

| 2. Show how the editor works, and ask the participants to add     |               | Computer      |
|    basic information about themselves to their user page.         |               | connected     |
| 3. Demonstrate how to use the buttons at the top of the editor    |               | internet      |
|    to make the formatting look better.                            |               | Module 6      |
| 4. Teach basic formatting. It does not need to be commplex. The   |               |               |
|    important thing is for participants to understand the basic    |               |               |
|    concepts.                                                      |               |               |
