Shakemap Converter
==================

Shakemaps are useful for carrying out contingency planning for an earthquake
event. Normally these are distributed as grid.xml files which are not
usable in |project_name| or QGIS. The Shakemap Converter tool imports a grid.xml 
file as a GEOTIFF file so that it can be used within |project_name|.

Two different interpolation algorithms can be used during the import process -
**Nearest Neighbour** and **Inverse Distance**. After the conversion, the tool
automatically creates |project_name| keyword metadata for the layer so that
it can be used immediately for analysis.

To use this tool effectively:

* Select a :file:`grid.xml` file for the input layer.
* Add the title of the shakemap that will be used for the keywords.
* Add the source of the shakemap that will also be used for the keywords.
* Choose where to write the output layer to.
* Choose the interpolation algorithm that should be used when converting the
  xml grid to a raster. If unsure keep the default.

You can obtain shake data for free from the `USGS
shakemap site <http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/list.php?y=2013>`_.

When you download the grid file, you should right-click on it and choose
:menuselection:`Save as` in order to ensure that it is saved properly. OSX and
Linux users may also consider using command line tools to fetch the grid file:

OSX::

   curl -O http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/global/shake/<shake id>/download/grid.xml

Linux::

   wget -C http://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/shakemap/global/shake/<shake id>/download/grid.xml

.. note:: Replace the <shake id> in the commands above with the actual shake id.
