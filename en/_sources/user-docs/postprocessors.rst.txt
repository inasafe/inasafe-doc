Post-processors
================

This document explains the purpose of post-processors and lists the
different available post-processors and the requirements each has to be
used effectively.

What is a post-processor?
-------------------------

A post-processor is a function that takes the results from the impact function
and calculates derivative indicators. For example, if you have an affected
population total, the **Gender** post-processor will calculate gender specific
indicators such as additional nutritional requirements for pregnant women.

Selecting a post-processor
--------------------------

Post-processors and their settings can be edited in the user configurable
function parameters dialog. See :ref:`analysis_parameters` for more
information.

To disable a post-processor simply go to the :guilabel:`Postprocessors` tab
and enable or disable any post-processor you like by clicking on the checkbox
next to it. You can even set the post-processing values you like here by
entering the values in the fields.

If you don't see a post-processors field, it means that the impact function
you are trying to use does not support any post-processor.

Each activated post-processor will create an additional report in the dock and
in the printout. If problems arise while post-processing, the system will
inform you and will skip post-processing.

Creating post-processors
------------------------

If you feel there is an important post-processor which is missing,
there are two avenues you can follow:

* You can develop it yourself or with the aid of a programmer who has a good
  understanding of the python programming language.
* You can file a ticket on our `issue tracking system
  <https://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues>`_, and if time and resources allow
  we will implement it for you.
