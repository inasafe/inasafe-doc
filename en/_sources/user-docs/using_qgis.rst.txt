Using QGIS
==========

|project_name| uses |QGIS| as the platform on which to provide its
functionality.
|QGIS| itself has good documentation and a very helpful user community.
In this section we focus on those aspects of |QGIS| functionality that will be
helpful to someone wanting to carry out impact scenario assessments using
|project_name|.

There are three good resources to get you up to speed with using GIS in
general and |QGIS| in particular:

* The `Gentle Introduction to GIS <http://linfiniti.com/dla>`_ by Linfiniti
  Consulting - it is a free electronic book that introduces the concepts of GIS
  in a very easy to read manner.
* The `QGIS User Manual <http://qgis.org/en/documentation/manuals.html>`_ -
  also an electronic book that serves as a reference guide to the |QGIS|
  Desktop Application.
* The `QGIS Training Manual <http://manual.linfiniti.com>`_ by Linfiniti
  Consulting that provides a detailed training guide on |QGIS| and PostGIS.
