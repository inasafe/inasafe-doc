<h3>Foreword<a class="headerlink" href="#foreword" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Communication is the main skill for someone to become a trainer. There are
several things that need to be understood including the meaning and purpose of
communication and Principles of Proper or Effective Communication. So is the
case for the trainer of Contingency Plan Development Scenarios using
OpenStreetMap (OSM) and QGIS / InaSAFE.</p>
<p>Communication in everyday life plays a very important part, this is because
communication has the function to connect a person’s wishes to others.
Specifically, communication runs four functions, i.e. the function of control,
motivation, emotional expression and information.</p>
<p>Communication is generally defined as the process of creating the meaning of
ideas or ideas presented. The trainer’s interests in training will naturally
require effective communication, used as a mean to convey ideas and motivate
someone to do something in accordance with the purpose of the training. The
ideas will be presented in this training are all about disaster, in particular
the Contingency Plan Development Scenarios using OpenStreetMap (OSM) and QGIS /
InaSAFE. Related to this, the trainer has to have the basic skills in teaching
or training because training is basically teaching the participants to be able
to do something.</p>
</section>
<section id="the-principles-of-effective-communication">
<h3>1. The principles of effective communication<a class="headerlink" href="#the-principles-of-effective-communication" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Communication is generally defined as the process of creating the meaning of
ideas or ideas presented. In this case communication requires at least 4
components or elements, i.e. (1) The sender or messenger/ communicator,
(2) the message, (3) the recipient of the message/ communicant, (4) Media/
channel. In effective communication process, communicator and communicant not
only performed linear communication, but also expected to performed circular
communication.</p>
<p>Linear communication model is a process that consists of two straight lines,
where the communication process starts from the communicator and ends at the
communicant. The circular model of communication, on the other hand, is a
communication process that not only starts from the communicator and ends at
the communicant, but also pays attention to the feedback from the communicant,
making the model a full circle process. This means that the trainer can be the
source of information at one time and the recipient at another time, vice versa.
Participants can be the recipient of information but also the source of
information. So communication is a simultaneous notice or exchange.</p>
<p>The communication process indicates that the trainee can act both as the
recipient of information/ message and the source of information/ message. But
the trainer as the actor in the process of communication still has to control
the training process. Therefore the trainer remains as the communicator, as
communicator plays a very important part especially in controlling the course
of communication, so that the message is well received by the recipient
(communicant) or the participants. This is in accordance with the function of
communication.</p>
<p>The function of communication according to Gordon I Zinmmerman in Thomas M.
Scheidel (1976) is a function of the content, which involves the exchange of
information we need to complete our task, and the function of relationship,
which involves the exchange of information about how our relationship is with
others. While the function of communication according to Thomas M. Scheidel
(1976) is: “We communicate primarily to represent and support self-identity,
to establish social contact, to influence others to feel, think and act as we
want.</p>
<p>The two opinions above indicate that the purpose of communication is for the
recipient to understand and comprehend the message conveyed by the messenger.
Trainers are expected to explain the wish or the idea according to the purpose
of the training to the participants with a simple but precise or accurate way.
Here communication process is expected to pay attention to the feedback from
the participants.</p>
<p>Communication is the message
conveyed to the communicant (recipient) by the communicator (source) through
certain channels either directly/ indirectly for the purpose of giving impact/
effect to the communicant as desired by the communicator. It goes through 5
stages, i.e. (1) Interpretation, (2) Encryption, (3) Delivery, (4) Acceptance,
and (5) Feedback. To achieve the objective of communication, the principles of
effective communication are also required. To have a smooth communication, it
is necessary to use the principle of effective communication. Principles include
Respect, Empathy, Audible, Clarity, and Humble.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p><strong>Respect</strong>.</p>
<p>Respect is the positive feeling or respect for the listener. Everyone wants
to be appreciated and respected and it has become the need of each
individual. For that reason, the trainer is expected to respect the other
person, or in this case the trainees.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Empathy</strong>.</p>
<p>Empathy is the ability to put yourself in situations or conditions faced by
others. Communication will be well established in accordance with good
psychological condition of our counterpart. To empathize means that the
trainer has to put himself as a good listener, even before anyone else
listens to him. And he must be able to feel what is perceived by the
trainees.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Audible</strong>.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Audible implies that the message must be able to be heard and understood.
In this matter what has to be done by the trainer are</p></li>
<li><p>The message must be easily understood, using proper and correct grammar.
Avoid languages unfamiliar to others.</p></li>
<li><p>Convey the important part of the message by simplifying the message,
straight to the point because most people don’t like listening to
long-winded things.</p></li>
<li><p>Use body language. Facial expressions, eye contact, hand gestures and body
positions can be easily read by the interlocutor.</p></li>
<li><p>Use illustrations or examples. Analogy really helps in conveying the
message. You could use real life examples and illustrations.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Clarity</strong>.</p>
<p>Clarity is the clarity of the messages we convey. On this principle the
trainer has set clear objectives before the training and uses a good tone of
voice.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Humble</strong>.</p>
<p>Humility gives positive prestige for the communicator. In this case, humble
is done by giving participants a chance to speak first and the trainer being
a good listener. This attitude builds respect and eventually develops respect
for the participants.</p>
</li>

<h3>2. Communication models in training<a class="headerlink" href="#communication-models-in-training" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>Communication in training is a process of delivering communication conditioned
for training purposes. The training process is essentially a communication
process delivering messages containing training materials. In this regard the
training is expected to use a circular model of communication, which is a
process that not only starts from the communicator and ends at communicant,
but also pays attention to the feedbacks from the communicant, to make the
communication effective.</p>
<p>Effective communication in training is expected to use verbal and non-verbal
communication. Verbal communication is communication using verbal symbols/ words
verbally. Non-verbal communication is the kind of communication not using verbal
words, but gestures, body language, facial expressions, and eye contact. It
could also be done with the use of objects such as clothes, haircuts and so
forth.</p>
<p>Non-verbal communication will help the trainer to become an interesting speaker.
Verbal communication has to be supported by means of talking such as intonation,
giving emphasis, sound quality, style of speech and emotion. It also uses
gestures, body language, facial expressions, eye contact, and supported by the
use of objects such as clothes, haircuts, and so forth.</p>
<section id="training-methods">
<h4>Training methods<a class="headerlink" href="#training-methods" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h4>
<p>Training is essentially a learning process that contains three elements, i.e.
inputs (raw materials to be processed), process (activity to process inputs) and
outputs (results that have been processed). Input of the training is the
participants before starting the training, the training process is the
interaction between the components of teaching and learning which are the
objectives, materials, methods, participants, facilities and assessment. The
output of the training is the participants after finishing the training.</p>
<p>A process is considered good if the output quality is better than the input.
The learning process or training is a behavioral change, which occurs as the
result of experience. This means it can only be called as a learning process if
a person is showing different behavior. He needs to prove the new knowledge of
facts, or do something which he couldn’t previously. Thus, the learning process
puts someone from one capability or competence status to the other.</p>
<p>Communication model training is one component in the training process because it
is actually a method implementation in training. To maximize output in the
training, a trainer has to select a training method in accordance with the other
components, such as the objectives, materials, trainees, facilities and
assessment. So to be able to achieve the objectives set in the training, methods
of training and communication should receive special attention in any training
process.</p>
<p>A good trainer should understand the characteristics of participants in order
for him to succeed in carrying out his teaching role. A trainer is expected to
plan the learning process according to the circumstances and the personality of
the trainees. A method is a way to achieve the objectives well. The methods can
be classified into 5, i.e. direct learning, indirect learning, interactive
learning, experiential learning, and independent learning.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p><strong>Direct learning</strong>: Direct learning is the kind of learning that is directed
by the trainer. This strategy is effective to determine the information or
skills to build incrementally. Direct learning is usually deductive. Examples
of the direct learning methods are: lecture, discussion, demonstration and
drill exercises.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Indirect learning</strong>: Generally centered on the trainees. The role of the
trainer shifted from a lecturer to a facilitator. The trainer manages the
learning environment and gives the trainees the opportunity to get involved.
Examples of indirect methods of learning are inquiry, case studies, problem
solving, concept mapping.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Interactive learning</strong>: Interactive learning emphasizes on discussion and
sharing among participants. Discussion and sharing give trainees the
opportunity to react to ideas, the trainer’s or his partner’s experience and
approach and to build an alternative way to think and feel. Examples of this
method are class discussions, small group discussions or projects, work in
pairs.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Experiential learning</strong>: Empirical learning is oriented on inductive
activities, centered on the trainees, and is activity based. Personal
reflection on the experience and planning formulation towards implementation
in other contexts is a critical factor in an effective empirical learning.
Examples of empirical learning method are role playing, observation / survey,
and simulation.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Independent learning</strong>: Independent learning is a teaching strategy that
aims to develop individual initiative, self-reliance, and self improvement.
The focus is on the trainees’ planning with the help from the trainer.
Self-learning can also be done with a friend or in a small group. Examples of
Independent learning methods are research projects and computer-based
learning.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>a. Methods in direct learning</strong></p>
<p>Direct learning is usually identified with the lecture method, where learning is
presumably making the participants less active. However, direct learning can
still be used together with question and answer, demonstrations, and exercises.
Furthermore, a few ways can be used to make more this method more effective, for
example:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Participants review the training materials that have been studied and the new
materials recently presented:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>materials well managed part by part</p></li>
<li><p>use visual media (important to read)</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Participants exercise with the trainer’s guidance.</p></li>
<li><p>Participants exercise independently</p></li>
<li><p>Participants’ improvement of skills/ knowledge are monitored periodically</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Various methods can be developed when students receive an explanation from the
teacher, among others:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Example and analogy</strong>: A trainer provides examples and illustrations
associated with the materials. He can also make comparisons between
participants’ experiences with the training materials.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Games</strong>: A trainer uses games in learning. The games are expected to be in
accordance with the training topic. Examples of them would be guessing
pictures, mystery in a box, or various types of quizzes from TV can be
implemented in a training class with some modifications (e.g. who wants to
millionaires, GameZone, word games, etc.).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Response card</strong>: Trainer asks participants to answer questions on a card or
piece of paper anonymously. Question cards or answer cards can be developed.
On the cards participants get different questions and they would be asked to
answer by raising hands; use open-ended, productive or imaginative questions.
On the answer cards the participants get answer cards, he would rasie his
hand when the card matches the trainer’s questions; use open-ended,
productive or imaginative questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Polls</strong>: A trainer can conduct a short survey to obtain data quickly. This
can be done with a verbal survey, for example by asking participants to raise
their hands or lift the answer cards</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problems</strong>: Trainer asks problems related with training topic.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Demonstrations</strong>: Trainer or participants can demonstrate something
according to the topic by using gestures or properties.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review newspaper or news</strong>: Participants are asked to review newspaper or
news from other readings.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Brainstorm</strong>: Participants are asked to argue about something related with
the training topics. Opinions will be accommodated for with conclusions drawn
on the subject matter discussed.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The method can be developed after the participants received proper explanation
from the trainer, among others:</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Sharing notes</strong>: after a series of events trainee compare their notes with
other colleagues’</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Q&amp;A</strong>: participants are given the opportunity to ask questions related to
the concept and its application. If there are no questions from the
participants, the trainer can ask them first.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Headline</strong>: trainer summarizes lessons with key words to be easily
remembered.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Methods to determine participants’ mastery of the concepts that have been
studied</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>One minute paper</strong>: This activity can be done at the end of training. Ask
the participants to take out a piece of paper. Ask an open-ended or closed
question related with the concepts that have been studied. Give one or two
minutes for participants to answer.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Reflection</strong>: ask one or two participants to come forward and express their
impressions towards the learning. Reflection can also provoke feelings and
difficulty in following the study.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Quiz</strong>: participants raise several issues or questions related with the
concept and ask other participants to answer. Quiz can be done by including
the name of the participants or anonymously. Quiz can also be used with
competition, puzzles, or the like. Quiz can be done verbally; using
open-ended, productive, or imaginative questions.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Tournament</strong>: participants compete in groups to solve problems related to
the concepts that have been studied. The winning group will get a certain
reward.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Review</strong>: Ask participants to review the lessons with others or give them a
review test scores.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>b. Indirect learning method</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Inquiry</strong>: participants conduct observation. Based on the result, they may
ask questions. Furthermore, participants formulate allegations, and collect
data. Based on the data, participants are asked to conclude.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Problem solving</strong>: Each participant is asked to formulate a problem clearly
and concisely, identifying factors that cause the problem, collect required
information (facts and knowledge), determine various solutions and choose the
most appropriate one, test the chosen solution, and review the result.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Trading</strong>: Each participant writes down one thing (e.g. experience,
creative ideas, questions, opinion, etc.) on a piece of paper, then stick it
up on his shirt. Walk around to sell and buy (read) the results of others.
Set a rule that every work has to be sold and bought. Classically, present
the result in turn. Trainer will provide reinforcement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Case study analysis</strong>: participants are given a case to be solved either
individually or in groups based on data, facts or concepts they have learned
in class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluating a friend’s work</strong>: it can be done after developing a product.
Participants generally use a rubric to evaluate the results of his friend’s
work</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>c. Interactive learning method</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Group discussion</strong>: Trainer asks participants to form groups of three or
more to share information.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Think, pair and share</strong>: propose a problem to the participants. Give
participants 2-5 minutes chance to think. When finished, ask them to discuss
the same issue with the person next to them for 3-5 minutes (pair). Finally,
select a pair to express their opinions in front of the class (share).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Group investigation</strong>: Participants form groups. Trainer calls the leader
of the groups and gives different materials/ task. Each group will discuss
the task cooperatively and will perform investigations. Upon completion, a
representative will present the results of the discussion. Trainer will
provide reinforcement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>TGT (Team Game Tournament) method</strong>: Trainer presents new material.
Participants form study groups heterogeneously. Each group will participate
in academic tournament. Each will represent the group in the tournament.
Give reward to the winning team.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Jigsaw</strong>: Trainer prepares a number of tasks matching the number of groups.
Participants will form groups with the number of members equal to the number
of groups (participants have to memorize the group members). Each group
member will be given different part of the materials. Participants from
different groups will form new groups and discuss their parts. Upon
completion of discussions with a group of experts, each group member will go
back to the original group and, in turn, teach/ report the discussion result
to other group members. Participants randomly present all the tasks given by
the trainer. Reinforcement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Debate</strong>: The trainer divides the participants into two debate groups of
pros and cons. Each group will read the materials that will be debated.
Appoint one member of the pros group to speak and rebutted by a member of the
cons, and so on. Trainer writes down ideas from the debate on a board the
number of ideas the trainer expected has been met. The trainer adds more
unrevealed ideas. From the ideas on the board, the trainer asks participants
to draw conclusion/ summary by referring to the competency desired.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>STAD (Student Team Achievement Division)</strong>: Learning from trainer.
Participants form groups. Each group discusses issues given (each participant
should understand the group’s answer). One person from each group will work
on the questions (quiz). Scores of each member will determine the score of
the group. Reinforcement.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Collaborative learning group</strong>: participants form heterogeneous groups of
3-6 people. Ask one of the participants to become the leader and another to
take note. Give participants the opportunity to learn collaboratively. The
result will be submitted in the form of a written report.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Learn in pairs</strong>: Trainer asks participants to perform tasks or discussions
with friends nearby in pairs. Pairs are suitable for learning complicated
tasks.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>d. Experiential learning method</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p><strong>Role play</strong>: each group is asked to design a role play based on the concept
being studied. Groups will respond to other groups’ role play result.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Simulation/ exercise</strong>: after participants learnt about certain motoric
skills, they will randomly be asked to exercise the skills they have learnt
in class.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>e. Independent learning</strong></p>

<div><p><strong>Project:</strong> Project method is a way of presenting the lessons, starting from
a problem where the solution requires a review of various point of views. The
rationale for the use of this method is that the problem can only be solved
by different school of thoughts or knowledge. Only problems that need unit
problem solving can be solved with project method.</p>

<h3>3. Components of basic skills in teaching / training<a class="headerlink" href="#components-of-basic-skills-in-teaching-training" title="Link to this heading">¶</a></h3>
<p>In interaction or face-to-face meeting with the trainees, trainer requires some
basic teaching skills. It is absolutely necessary to help the trainer in playing
the role in educational interaction. The trainer’s teaching basic skills are not
different than the teachers who teach in the classroom. Those basic skills are:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Skill to open and close the session</p></li>
<li><p>Explanation skill</p></li>
<li><p>Inquiry basic skill</p></li>
<li><p>Skill to make variations</p></li>
<li><p>Skills to provide reinforcement</p></li>
<li><p>Skills to manage the class</p></li>
<li><p>Skills to guide a small group discussion</p></li>
<li><p>Individual teaching skill</p></li>
<li><p>Skill of small groups</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>a. Skill to open and close the session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition and Purpose</strong></p>
<p>Opening a session is associated with the trainer creating conducive mental
atmosphere and attracting participants’ attention to focus on what will be
studied. While closing the session is when the trainer ending the core of the
activities, which is giving an overall picture of what has been studied, knowing
the participants, and the trainer’s rate of success in the training process.
Opening and closing of the session have are meant to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>attract interests and motivate participants on the task at hand</p></li>
<li><p>enable participants to know the limits of the task at hand</p></li>
<li><p>enable participants to find out the approach that is going to be used</p></li>
<li><p>enable participants to determine the relationship between mastered
experiences with new things to be learned</p></li>
<li><p>give the participants the possibility to combine facts, skills, and concepts
covered in an event</p></li>
<li><p>enable participants to determine the level of success</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Components of Opening the Session Skill</strong></p>
<p>Opening a session can be done by:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Attracting participants’ interest</p>
<p>A few ways can be done by the trainer to attract the participants’ interest,
among others:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Variation of training style and patterns of interaction</p></li>
<li><p>The use of training aids</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Motivating</p>
<p>Creating motivation can be done by:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Showing warmth and enthusiasm</p></li>
<li><p>Creating curiosity</p></li>
<li><p>Expressing opposite ideas</p></li>
<li><p>Paying attention to the participants’ interests</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Giving references</p>
<p>Giving references is an effort to give clear picture of the things that will
be studied by means of inserting a short series of specific and relevant
alternatives, by:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Expressing the objectives and limitation of task</p></li>
<li><p>Advising steps to be taken, reminding the subject matter to be discussed</p></li>
<li><p>Asking questions</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Making connections</p>
<p>Some of the trainer’s efforts in making connections:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Making links between relevant aspects of training with the materials
known to participants</p></li>
<li><p>Comparing or contrasting the new knowledge and the ones known to them</p></li>
<li><p>Explaining the concept first and then the detailed description</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Basic Skills Components of Closing the Session</strong></p>
<p>Closing the session is intended to obtain a complete picture at the end of the
activity, and to determine the participants’ level of achievement or the
participants’ success rate. There are a few ways to that can be done in closing
the session, among others:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Review the core content of the session and making a summary</p></li>
<li><p>Evaluate the various forms of evaluation, for example:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Demonstrate skills</p></li>
<li><p>Ask participants to apply new ideas in other situations</p></li>
<li><p>Explore the participants’ opinions</p></li>
<li><p>Provide written questions</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Use Principles</strong></p>
<p>A few principles that need to be considered by a trainer when opening and
closing the session are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Significance</p></li>
<li><p>To draw participants’ attention or motivation, a trainer has to select a way
relevant with the content and the objective of the teaching</p></li>
<li><p>Sequential and continuous</p></li>
<li><p>Activities taken by trainer in introducing and summarizing the main points of
the lessons should be an integral part, the link between one part and another
or with the participants’ experience should be clear</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>b. Explanation skill</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Explaining/ describing something is presenting verbal information that is
organized systematically to show an association with one another. The emphasis
of explaining is the participants’ reasoning process and not indoctrination.
Examples: providing an overview of a situation, revealing causes of an event,
etc. The success of explaining is marked by the participants’ understanding of
something. The structure of teaching materials in explaining is usually planned
in a way that can be controlled. Logical description, the skill to reveal the
materials and the strategy to organize the materials are the main procedure to
explain.</p>
<p>Explaining is linked with the effort to create linkages between the known and
the unknown. A full explanation is always accompanied by evidence and the cause
and effect is based on the logical relationships between generalization,
provisions, and realities according to the participants’ perception system.</p>
<p>The objective of explanation skills are to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Provide understanding to others</p></li>
<li><p>Make participants think logically and systematically</p></li>
<li><p>Train participants to think based on the causes and reasons</p></li>
<li><p>Train participants in making decisions independently</p></li>
<li><p>Instill the right way of thinking attitude</p></li>
<li><p>Guide participants to a clear understanding in solving the question: What,
Why and How</p></li>
<li><p>Engage participants in thinking to solve problems</p></li>
<li><p>Obtain feedback from participants based on levels of understanding</p></li>
<li><p>Assist participants to use the process of transmission and evidences in
solving problems</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Components of Explanation Skills</strong></p>
<p>In the planning process, the components of explanation skills include:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Planning explanation</p>
<p>In planning explanation, we need to pay attention to the contents of the
message that will be conveyed and the readiness of the recipient. Things
related to the content of the message (the material) including:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Analyzing problems holistically</p></li>
<li><p>Determining the type of existing relationship between the linked elements</p></li>
<li><p>Using the law, formulation, or generalization that is suitable with the
determined relationship</p></li>
</ol>
<p>What we need to pay attention when associated with the message recipient
(participant) is to whom the explanation will be presented to, such as age,
gender, ability, social background, and participants’ learning environment.
Thus what needs to be considered in connection with the recipient of this
message is:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>The explanation must be relevant to the participants’ problems</p></li>
<li><p>The explanation has to be easily accepted by the participants</p></li>
<li><p>The explanation has to match the participants’ wealth of knowledge at the
time</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Presenting explanation</p>
<p>A few things to notice in presenting an explanation are:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Clarity, can be achieved by:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>The articulation has to be clear, the words, the idioms and the voice</p></li>
<li><p>Conversation has to go smooth by avoiding unnecessary words, e.g. ee,
aa, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Sentences have to be arranged with good grammar by avoiding incomplete
sentences</p></li>
<li><p>Technical or new terms should be defined clearly</p></li>
<li><p>Using pause time (silent) to see whether the explanation has been
understood by the participants</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Usage of examples and illustrations, including</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Inductive: Example/ illustration concept/ generalization</p></li>
<li><p>Deductive: Concept/ generalization examples/ illustrations</p></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Provision of emphasis, including the use of voice variation, mimic,
gestures, summary, repetition, giving symbols, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>It is important to show important parts that need attention from others</p></li>
<li><p>Organization, including creating relationship between examples, clear
generalization and summarizing during or at the end of the presentation</p></li>
<li><p>Feedback, including a behavioral change from the participants and
providing the opportunity for participants to answer questions as well as
expressing opinions on whether the explanation given by the trainer is
useful</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>c. Inquiry basic skill</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition and Purpose</strong></p>
<p>Asking a question can be interpreted as a greeting delivered with the intention
of requesting a response from others. In the teaching process, the given
response reflects the extent to which level of knowledge the participants have.
So asking questions in the session is important because the trainer’s skill in
asking effective questions will be the stimulus that will stimulate thinking
skills and will encourage participants.</p>
<p>The purpose of asking includes:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Stimulate participants’ thinking skills</p></li>
<li><p>Assist participants in learning</p></li>
<li><p>Direct the participants independent interaction level on level of
self-learning interaction.</p></li>
<li><p>Increase participants’ thinking component of low-level components to a higher
level</p></li>
<li><p>Assist participants in achieving the learning objectives</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Components of Inquiry Basic Skill</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Basic skills</p>
<p>Components included in the inquiry basic skill are:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Disclosure of questions clearly and concisely</p></li>
<li><p>Details in asking questions so that participants can answer correctly, the
trainer needs to provide information that will help make examples of the
question</p></li>
<li><p>Convergence towards the accepted answer</p></li>
<li><p>Convergence can be done by means of: providing a broad question
(open-ended) which will convert into a narrow question</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer of turns to answer</p></li>
<li><p>Transfer of turns can be done by asking different participants to answer
the same question</p></li>
<li><p>The spread of questions</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For certain purposes the coach can throw the question to the whole class, to
a participant or spread from one participant to the others.</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p>Provision of time to think</p>
<p>In asking question, a trainer has to stay silent a moment before
appointing a participant to answer the questions</p>
</li>
<li><p>Provision of guidance</p>
<p>For participants having difficulty in answering the question, a strategy
to provide guidance needs to be given.
The strategy includes the disclosure of the question with other form or
manner, asking other simpler questions, and repeats the previous
explanations.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Advance level skills, components added:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>The conversion of rate of cognitive guidance in answering the question</p></li>
<li><p>To develop the participants’ way of think we need cognitive level of
guidance questions (recall, comprehension, application, systematic
analysis, and evaluation)</p></li>
<li><p>Setting the order of questions</p></li>
<li><p>The questions asked have to have a logical sequence</p></li>
<li><p>The use of tracing questions</p></li>
<li><p>To find out to which extent the participants’ skill in regards to the
answer,  the tracing skill that needs to be mastered by the trainer.
Tracing can be done by asking participants to give explanation on the
answer, giving a reason, providing relevant examples, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>The skill to encourage interaction between participants</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>d. Skills to provide reinforcement</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition and Purpose</strong></p>
<p>There are two kinds of reinforcements, positive and negative reinforcement.
Positive reinforcement is the trainer’s behavior in responding positively to a
particular behavior of participants that allows such behavior to reoccur. While
negative reinforcement is the removal or a reduction of unpleasant stimuli to
encourage the reoccurrence of the behavior that arises as the result of the
reduction or removal.</p>
<p>The purpose of reinforcement is to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>increase the participants’ attention</p></li>
<li><p>Smoothen/ facilitate the learning process</p></li>
<li><p>Generating and maintaining motivation</p></li>
<li><p>Controlling or changing disturbing attitudes and behavior</p></li>
<li><p>Developing and organizing themselves in learning</p></li>
<li><p>Driving the way of thinking that is good / divergent and personal initiative</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Reinforcement is given during:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Attention to the coach, friend, or the object of discussion</p></li>
<li><p>The study, reading, working on the board behavior</p></li>
<li><p>The completion of work</p></li>
<li><p>The quality of work/ tasks (grooming, beauty)</p></li>
<li><p>Repair/ improvement tasks</p></li>
<li><p>Independent tasks</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Components of Reinforcement Basic Skills</strong></p>
<p>The use of in-class skill components should be carefully selected, tailored to
the participants’ ages, capability level, needs and background, the purpose and
nature of the task. Reinforcement must be meaningful from the participants.</p>
<p>Some components of providing reinforcement are:</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Positive reinforcement</p>
<ol class="loweralpha">
<li><p>Verbal reinforcement</p>
<p>Reinforcement can be verbal words that are spoken by the teacher. Examples
of it are good, well, precise, I appreciate the income, very intelligent
mind, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gestural reinforcement</p>
<p>This reinforcement is given in the form of gestures, facial or limb
movements that can give the impression to the students.
For example: Lifting an eyebrow, smiling, leering eyes, applause, nodding
in agreement, raising the thumb sign, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Approaching reinforcement</p>
<p>This reinforcement is done by approaching students to express the
trainer’s concern for the work, behavior or appearance of the
participants. For example: the trainer sits in a group, stands next to a
participant. Often the trainer approaches participants to give them verbal
reinforcement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reinforcement through touches</p>
<p>A trainer can express appreciation to the participants by patting them,
shaking their hands or raising their hands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Reinforcement by providing fun activities</p>
<p>This reinforcement may be in the form of asking participants to help his
friends when he has finished his work properly, participants are asked to
lead activities, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Symbolic reinforcement or with objects</p>
<p>This form of reinforcement is the trainer’s effort in using a variety of
symbols to support the reinforcement of positive behavior of participants.
This form of reinforcement include commentary written in the work book,
giving stamps, money data collection, star, percentage and so on.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Negative reinforcement</p>
<p>The way this is done is the same with positive reinforcement, except that it
is not pleasant for the participants in order to reduce or remove their
actions.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>How to use the components:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Varies</p></li>
<li><p>Provide better reinforcement directly and immediately</p></li>
<li><p>For certain purposes the use of reinforcement can never be given. For
example, for participants who answered incorrectly, reinforcement is given to
participants in the effort of answering but not on the quality of the answer.
The trainer acts should be followed by asking the first participant to
imitate the answer or giving consideration to his answer</p></li>
<li><p>Providing reinforcement is a behavior that is easier said than done.
Therefore intensive exercises are done by the trainer candidates.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>e. Basic skills in Using Variations</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition and Purpose</strong></p>
<p>Using variations is defined as the trainer’s effort in in the context of the
training process that aims to overcome the participants’ boredom in following
the training, so that participants always show perseverance, as well as
enthusiasm and active participation.</p>
<p>Use in class is for:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Maintaining and improving the participants in issues related to the learning
aspects</p></li>
<li><p>Improving the possibility of motivation and curiosity through investigation
and exploration</p></li>
<li><p>Establishing a positive attitude towards the trainer</p></li>
<li><p>The possibility of individual participants to be served so that it gives the
ease in learning</p></li>
<li><p>Encouraging learning activities that engage participants in a variety of
activities. Learning, interesting and useful in a variety of cognitive levels</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Components of Making Variations Skill</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>Variation in training style</p>
<p>Variety of trainer’s teaching styles include these components:</p>
<ol class="loweralpha simple">
<li><p>Voice variation: loud weak, fast slow, high low, great and small</p></li>
<li><p>Concentration of attention. Focusing attention can be done verbally, or by
using capital symbols</p></li>
<li><p>Silence. By the time the trainer has finished explaining, activities are
often observed to pause abruptly in a short moment</p></li>
<li><p>There is a time of silence when the trainer is moving from one teaching
segment to the other</p></li>
<li><p>Eye contact.  To improve the relationship with the students and avoid
impersonal things, then eye contact is required during teaching process</p></li>
<li><p>Gestures and lyrics: the change in face expression, head movement, body
movement is very important in communication process</p></li>
<li><p>The change in trainer’s position. The participants’ attention can be
improved by the change in trainer’s position in the communication
interaction process</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
<li><p>Variations in the use of media and teaching materials</p>
<p>Variations in any type of media or variations between media type need to be
considered in the learning process</p>
</li>
<li><p>Variations of interaction pattern and participant’s activity</p>
<p>The range of interaction can move between the two extreme poles, the trainer
as the center of activities and participants as the center of activities.
Changes in the interaction between the two poles will result in an activity
pattern that is experienced by the participants.
From the description above, it is clear that the skills in using variations
are wider compared with the skill of providing reinforcement and inquiry
skills.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>The principles that need to be understood</strong></p>
<p>The principles which will need the use of natural variation among others are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Changes have to be smooth and accurate</p></li>
<li><p>The use of variation technique should be smooth and accurate</p></li>
<li><p>The use of the variation components must be completely structured and planned
in advance</p></li>
<li><p>The use of variation components to be flexible and spontaneous based on
participant feedback</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>f. Classroom Management Skills</strong></p>
<p><strong>Definition</strong></p>
<p>Classroom management is the creation of conditions that enable the training
management to take place optimally. This is in contrast to the management of
learning, i.e. the teaching itself involving the material components, methods,
and training aids in achieving the learning objectives.</p>
<p>Examples of learning management problems are unclear learning objectives, the
subject matter is too easy or too hard, medium or inappropriate learning
methods, the materials are not in systematic order, etc. While examples of
classroom management problems are sleepy participants, crowded classroom,
participants not doing the tasks, participants teasing others, broken seats,
dirty classroom, etc.</p>
<p>Managing a class is a function of the trainer as a manager. Management means the
organization or management in order for things to run smoothly, effectively, and
efficiently. So in this case the function of a trainer is as a manager or an
organizer. While the purpose of managing the class is: (1) to create and
maintain an optimal learning condition, (2) to restore in the event of
disruption to the learning process</p>
<p><strong>Classroom Management Approaches</strong></p>
<p>Various classroom management approaches are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Behavior Modification approach</p></li>
<li><p>Social climate approach</p></li>
<li><p>Group process approach</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Behavior Modification Approach</strong></p>
<p>Behavior modification approach departs from behavior psychology with the basic
assumption that human behavior either good or bad, to a certain extent, is the
result of learning process. Thus, human behavior can be modified.</p>
<p>Modifications include using positive reinforcement techniques, negative
reinforcement, deletion, and punishment. Positive reinforcement is a response to
a behavior, which can increase the likelihood of reoccurrence of such behavior.
Negative reinforcement is a reduction to the removal of an unpleasant stimulus
to encourage the recurrence of a behavior that arises as a result of the
reduction or removal.</p>
<p>Principle of use:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Avoidance of painful stimulus</p></li>
<li><p>Clear target</p></li>
<li><p>Provision of immediate reinforcement</p></li>
<li><p>Presenting various stimulus</p></li>
<li><p>Enthusiasm</p></li>
<li><p>Combined with other techniques</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Social Climate Approach (Social-Emotional Climate)</strong></p>
<p>Social-emotional climate approach departs from clinical psychology and
counseling, with the basic assumption that the teaching and learning activities
are effective and efficient when there are social-emotional relationships
between participants and trainers and between participants. This can be pursued
by means of:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Open attitude</p></li>
<li><p>Acceptance and respect of participants</p></li>
<li><p>Empathy</p></li>
<li><p>Attitude to discuss the situation violations and violators</p></li>
<li><p>Democratic attitudes</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Group Process Approach</strong></p>
<p>Group process approach departs from social psychology and group dynamics, with
the basic assumption that the effective and efficient teaching and learning
activities take place in the context of a group, i.e. the class. For that task
the trainer has to create a class that has strong ties and can work effectively
and efficiently.</p>
<p>To create a good group bonding atmosphere we need the establishment of common
goals in the group, clear rules to bind the participants into groups, and
leadership within the group. And to maintain a healthy working environment, the
trainer needs to do for example:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Encourage and equalize participation</p></li>
<li><p>Work out a compromise</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce tension</p></li>
<li><p>Clarify communications</p></li>
<li><p>Addressing conflicts between individuals or groups</p></li>
<li><p>Showed that the presence of the participants are physically and
psychologically</p></li>
<li><p>Describe sanctions</p></li>
</ol>
