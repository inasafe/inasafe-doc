Getting involved
================

If you like the work we are doing with |project_name| and would like to
contribute, we will welcome your involvement.
We spend a lot of time and effort trying to make a robust,
user-friendly and useful software platform, but there is no substitute for
having interested users participating and sharing their needs,
problems and successes!
Here are a few simple ways you can get involved:

.. _visit_website:

Visit our web site!
-------------------

The web site will always contain the latest information on how to use
|project_name|.
We encourage anyone who wants to get involved with the project to first read
the content available on the site to familiarise themselves with the content.
The website is available at:

http://inasafe.org

If you need help in solving problems with |project_name| take
a look at :ref:`getting_help`.

.. _add_to_usermap:

Add yourself to the |project_name| Usermap!
-------------------------------------------

As a User/Trainer/Developer of |project_name| you are encouraged to add yourself
to the Usermap page available at:

http://users.inasafe.org/

Use the :guilabel:`Add me to map!` button on the left side and point the cross 
to the place where you live.
Fill in your user data and click on :guilabel:`Done!`.
Here you may also download the coordinates of all entered |project_name| users 
as a CSV file.

.. _use_issue_tracker:

Use our issue tracker!
----------------------

We maintain an issue tracker here:

http://github.com/AIFDR/inasafe/issues

On this page you can browse and search existing issues and create new issues.
The issue tracker is a great place to let us know about specific bugs you
encounter or tell us about new features you would like to see in the software.
Information about how to correctly file an issue is available in the
:ref:`issue_howto` section.

.. _irc_chat:

Chat live to developers on IRC!
-------------------------------

Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a chat room environment where you can talk (by
typing messages) to other |project_name| users and developers to discuss ideas 
and get help.
You can use your own IRC client and join #inasafe on the irc.freenode.net
network.
We also have a direct link on http://www.inasafe.org.
Click on :guilabel:`Chat live!` at the top of the page and join us in the 
channel.
Alternatively, you can use your web browser to join the chat room using the
link below:

http://webchat.freenode.net/

On the form that appears, choose a user name, enter #inasafe in the
:guilabel:`Channels:` box and complete the rest of the details in the form.
After logging in wait a few moments and you will be taken to the #inasafe
channel.

.. note:: Other people in the room may not be actively watching the channel,
   so just ask your question, leave the chat window open and check back
   every now and then until you see other chat room members become active.

.. _submit_your_code:

Submit your code!
-----------------

We must emphasise that |project_name| is **free** and **open source**.
That means anyone (or any organisation) can freely modify,
adapt and improve the software.
We welcome any contributions to |project_name|.

The easiest way to do this is to
`fork <https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo>`_ the |project_name|
code base on GitHub and then send us a
`pull request <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>`_.

We also welcome small improvements, translations or other fixes via the issue
management system mentioned above.

.. note:: We have strict requirements that all code submitted to
   |project_name| is compliant with high
   :doc:`/developer-docs/coding_standards` and is continually tested by a
   comprehensive regression testing system.
   We have this requirement in place to ensure a good experience for our
   users and to ensure that users can have confidence in the results produced
   by |project_name|.
