Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)

Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work,
especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out-of-date,
or rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and
open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with
GPS, digitising aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing
public sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (|HOT|)
is an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and
open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development.

Preface
-------
Every day thousands of people contribute to OSM,
a project with the lofty goal of mapping the world. Most OSM software is
free and open source, and the data is open for anyone to use. The idea is
simple: if you make a map of your town and we make a map of ours,
we can share those maps on a common platform. With enough people
contributing, we can collect data throughout the world.

Collecting Spatial Data using OSM Intermediate Level is a step-by-step course
designed to help those who wish to carry on from the beginner tutorial and
explore OSM in more detail. We recommend reviewing Collecting Spatial Data
using OSM Beginner Level prior to this unit.
