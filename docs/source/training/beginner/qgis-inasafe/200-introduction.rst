BNPB is Indonesia’s National Disaster Management Agency. |BNPB| is a
non-departmental ministerial-level government agency, tasked with providing
guidance and direction to the efforts of disaster management that includes
disaster prevention, emergency response, rehabilitation,
and reconstruction in a fair and equal way. National Disaster Management Agency
functions as a policy maker and formulator and Refugee (IDP)
management to act quickly and appropriately and effectively and efficiently.
It coordinates the implementation of disaster management activities in a
planned, integrated, and comprehensive way.

The Australia-Indonesia Facility for Disaster Reduction (|AIFDR|) is a joint
initiative between the governments of Australia and Indonesia. They work to
strengthen Indonesia's ability to reduce the impact of disasters. The
Australian and Indonesian governments at a special ceremony on 15 July 2010
launched the Australia-Indonesia facility. The launch marks an important
event in the strong relationship now shared by both countries and their
united commitment to better prepare for and respond to natural disasters in
Indonesia.

Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (HOT)

Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work,
especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out-of-date,
or rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and
open map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with
GPS, digitising aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing
public sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (|HOT|)
is an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and
open data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development.

Universitas Gadjah Mada (internationally known as Gadjah Mada University, or
UGM) is a top research university
located in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The Department of Geodetic Engineering and 
Faculty of Engineering focuses on education, research, and commmunity services 
related to geodesy and geomatics engineering, including acquisition, analysis, 
and uses of detailed and accurate geospatial data and large-scale maps using 
open source geospatial software for disaster management.

Preface
-------
A Geographic Information System (GIS) is a system designed to
enable people to work with data related to places on the Earth.
A GIS allows the creation, storage, manipulation, and analysis of geographic
data.
GIS is a very broad concept and can involve complex hardware and software.
But for most people’s purposes, a simple GIS software application is all that
is required.

GIS can be used in a variety of fields, including in disaster
management. In this training we use GIS software that is 
free and open, and which includes special functionality for the 
preparation of contingency plans.

The software, called |QGIS|, is a Geographic Information System (GIS) that is
user-friendly and open-source. |project_name| is a QGIS plugin which is also
free and open-source, can create realistic scenarios of natural disaster impact
for planning, preparation, and better response.
|project_name| is developed by |AIFDR| through consultation with |BNPB|.

Data Analysis Using QGIS and |project_name| covers different material from the
previous unit, complementing and building on top of it. Unit One was
about the collection of relevant data using OpenStreetMap. In this unit we will
explore how to use geographic data to better understand disaster impact and to
help develop contingency plans.
