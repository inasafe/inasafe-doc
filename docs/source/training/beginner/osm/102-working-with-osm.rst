Module 2: Working with OSM
==========================

**Learning Objectives**

- Visit OpenStreetMap website
- Navigate map on OSM website
- Save an image from OSM 
- Register an OSM account
- Edit the OSM map       
- Save edits             

In this module we will learn step-by-step how to navigate the OpenStreetMap
website, view and print maps, and sign up for a user account. After you
have your own username and password, you will be able to add your first
points to the map.

1. The OpenStreetMap website
----------------------------

1. Be sure that your computer is on and you are connected to the internet.

2. Open your web browser - Firefox, Chrome, Opera, or Internet Explorer.

3. In the address bar at the top of the window, enter the following text:
   `www.openstreetmap.org <http://www.openstreetmap.org>`_

When the page has finished loading, it should look something like this:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image12.*
   :align: center

2. Navigating the map
---------------------

4. The main thing we see is the map. Move the map by clicking on it
   with your left mouse button, holding the button down,
   and dragging your mouse around.

5. If you have a mouse with a scroll-wheel, zoom in and out on the map by
   turning the wheel. If you don’t have a scroll-wheel,
   click the :guilabel:`+` and :guilabel:`-` buttons in the upper right 
   corner of the map.

6. To search for a place, left-click in the box labeled
   :guilabel:`Search` on the left side of the page. Type in the name of your
   town or village and press Enter. A window should appear to the
   left of the map with the results of your search. Click on the location that
   looks closest to the one you want. The map will automatically move to the 
   location you choose.

3. Saving an image of the map
-----------------------------

To save an image from OSM that you can easily print,
follow these instructions:

7. Click the :guilabel:`Share` button on the right side of the map.

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image13.*
   :align: center

Options appear which look like this:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image14.*
   :align: center

8. In the :guilabel:`Image` section, check the box next 
   to :guilabel:`Set custom dimensions` to manually specify the extent of the
   area for download. Drag the box which appears to the area you would like
   to get as an image file.

9. Set the format to PNG, JPEG, SVG or PDF format according to your
   preference.

10. You may enter a scale in the next box. The larger the scale (meaning a
    smaller number), the larger the image size will be. Scale is a ratio. For 
    example, entering 5000 here means that objects on the map will be 1/5000th
    the size that they are in real life.

11. Click the :guilabel:`Download` button. The image will be created, downloaded 
    and saved to your computer.

12. Open the downloaded file. It can be printed by going 
    to :menuselection:`File ‣ Print`, after you connect your computer to a 
    printer.

4. Creating an OpenStreetMap account
------------------------------------

Now that we have seen the website, we must create an OSM account so
we can start mapping.

13. Return to the OSM website. Click :guilabel:`Sign Up` in the
    top right corner of the page.

You should see a new page that looks like this:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image15.*
   :align: center

There are five boxes on this page that you need to fill in to register an
account with OSM.

14. Enter your email address in the first two boxes. You should enter the same
    email address in both boxes. Later, you will need to open your email to
    confirm your account with OSM.

15. In the third box, enter the username that you would like to have. You
    will not be able to choose a username that someone else has chosen before,
    so it should be creative. If you try to enter something simple,
    like your first name, it is likely that someone has already claimed that
    name.

16. Enter a new password in the fourth and fifth boxes. Enter the
    same password in both boxes. It does not need to be the same as the
    password for your email.

17. You will need to remember your user name and your password so that you can
    login later.

18. After completing all the boxes, click :guilabel:`Continue` at the
    bottom of the page.

19. If there are any problems, an error message may pop up. Check to make
    sure that your email is the same in the first to boxes,
    and your password is the same in the bottom two boxes. If the third box is
    highlighted red, it means that someone else has already chosen your
    username, and you should try a different name.

19. Open a separate window or tab in your internet browser,
    and navigate to your email. Common email sites are
    `mail.yahoo.com <http://mail.yahoo.com>`_ and
    `gmail.com <http://gmail.com>`_.

20. Enter your email address and your email password to open your email. Note
    that this is not the same as your OSM username and password.

21. If everything was successful with your registration,
    you should see an email from OSM in your inbox. Open the email.
    It should look like the image below. Click on the link that is identified
    below:

.. image:: /static/training/beginner/osm/image16.*
   :align: center
   :width: 500pt
 
22. A new tab or window will open. If everything went well,
    you should have an OSM account!

23. On the OSM page, click :guilabel:`Log In` in the top right corner. Enter
    your OSM username and password and press Enter. You should now be
    logged in. You will see your username in the upper right corner of the
    page.

5. Adding your first points
---------------------------

Now that you are logged in with your username on the OSM website,
you can add your first point to the map.

24. Move the map to a place that you know very well, such as your town or village.

25. Zoom in to a place where you would like to add a point to the map.

26. Just above the map on the left, there is a button marked :guilabel:`Edit`. Click
    on the arrow next to it to open a drop-down menu.

27. Click :guilabel:`Edit with iD (in-browser editor)`

28. The online editor for OSM should open. For a tour of the editor, click
    :guilabel:`Start the Walkthrough`. To begin editing, click :guilabel:`Edit Now`.

29. Add a point to the map by clicking :guilabel:`Point` at the top, and then clicking
    a location on the map. Select the type of location from the menu on the left
    and add any other information that you know. If you are
    satisfied that the information is correct, click :guilabel:`Save` at the top.

.. Note::  If you are not sure about the accuracy of the point(s) you add,
           don’t click :guilabel:`Save`! Play around with the iD editor,
           but don’t save your changes.
