=================

We will introduce you to |project_name| (http://inasafe.org) - an extension
for QGIS that allows disaster managers to do better planning for disasters.
In this course we explain the conceptual domain - what |project_name| does
(and does not do), why it is important to use a tool such as |project_name|,
what kinds of hazards |project_name| can be used with and so on.
We then delve into the practical side of using |project_name|.

    * Understand the concept of hazard data
    * Understand the concept of exposure data
    * Understand the concept of aggregation data
    * Understand the concept of an impact layer

    * Be able to import a hazard layer and assign it appropriate keywords
    * Be able to import an exposure layer and assign it appropriate keywords
    * Be able to import an aggregation layer and assign it appropriate keywords

    * Be able to define keywords using the |project_name| keywords wizard
    * Be able to run |project_name| with aggregation data

    * Be able to use the |project_name| dock and the |project_name| Impact Function Centric Wizard; and
    * Be able to use the Generic Impact Function and understand how to use it to work with their own data.


* Practical application
    * Be able to explain the purpose of |project_name|
    * Be able to interpret |project_name| analysis results and use them in disaster management.
