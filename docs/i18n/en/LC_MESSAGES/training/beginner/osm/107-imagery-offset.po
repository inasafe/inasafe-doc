"Aerial imagery works the same, except that we talk about resolution "
"differently. Measurement is important with aerial photographs - hence, a "
"pixel represents a certain measurable area on the surface of the Earth. We "
"usually describe imagery as something like \"two metre resolution imagery\", "
"which means that one pixel in the image is equivalent to two metres on the "
"ground. One metre resolution imagery would have a higher resolution than "
"this, and 50cm resolution would be higher still. This is generally the range "
"of imagery that is provided by Bing, though it varies between locations, and "
"in many places it is worse than two metres, at which point it becomes "
"difficult to identify objects in the image."

"We’ve learned about two major ways of making maps - one is by utilising "

"picture, to observe various details from the image, consider your knowledge "
"of the area, and easily trace roads, buildings and areas. One key advantage "
"of GPS however, is that it doesn’t suffer from offset like imagery. A GPS "
"will always provide you with a correct latitude and longitude. The only "
"exception is when the satellite signals are interrupted by tall buildings or "
