"For best fit, the thin-plate spline or higher-number polynomial "
"transformations are often best. Its look like a true rubber sheeting method, "
"transforms the source Control Point exactly to the target Control Points, "
"and optimize for local accuracy opposed to global accuracy."

"paper map or an image that is not already georeferenced. Once the image is "
"georeferenced like this, it can be used at the same digitization techniques "
"that we will learn later. In the next chapter, we will create vector "
