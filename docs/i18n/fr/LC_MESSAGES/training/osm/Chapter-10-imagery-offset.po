"Using aerial imagery is the most widely used approach to mapping in "
"OpenStreetMap. Mappers typically use Bing Satellite, or imagery from another "
"provider as a background layer while mapping. We have already seen this in "
"previous sections."

"Imagery providers usually do a pretty good job of georeferencing their "
"imagery, but occasionally the images can be out of position. This is "
"particularly true in hilly or mountainous areas, where it can be difficult "
"to stretch a flat image over an area of the Earth with many contours. When "
"you load imagery in JOSM, it can sometimes be ten meters or more from its "
"true position. This is called imagery offset."

"We’ve learned about two major ways of making maps – one is by utilizing "
"aerial imagery to identify features on the ground, and another is by using "
"GPS to record tracks and waypoints and then add them to OpenStreetMap. The "
"advantages of aerial imagery is obvious. It is easier for you to see the "
"whole picture, to observe various details from the image, consider your "
"knowledge of the area, and easily trace roads, buildings, and areas."

"One key advantage of GPS, is that it doesn’t suffer from offset like "
"imagery. A GPS will always provide you with a correct latitude and "
"longitude. The only exception is when the satellite signals are interrupted "
"by high buildings and mountains, but in this case it is easy to recognize "
"the error. Showing the GPS track in this image, compared with Bing aerial "
"imagery layer in the below figure:"

"The best references for adjusting imagery are GPS tracks that follow roads. "

"their GPS tracks to the OSM database, we can download them and use them to "
