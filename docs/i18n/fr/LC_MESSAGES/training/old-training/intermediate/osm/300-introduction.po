"Free, collaborative maps are uniquely valuable to humanitarian work, "
"especially in places where base map data is often scarce, out-of-date, or "
"rapidly changing. OpenStreetMap is a web project to create a free and open "
"map of the entire world, built entirely by volunteers surveying with GPS, "
"digitising aerial imagery, and collecting and liberating existing public "
"sources of geographic data. The Humanitarian OpenStreetMap Team (|HOT|) is "
"an initiative to apply the principles and activities of open source and open "
"data sharing towards humanitarian response and economic development."
