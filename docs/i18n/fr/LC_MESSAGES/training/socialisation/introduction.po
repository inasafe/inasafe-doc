"The |project_name| project (http://inasafe.org) was started in order to "
"provide a tool for disaster managers who want to understand what the "
"potential impacts of a disaster will be. Initially the focus of activity was "
"in Indonesia - a country that is highly vulnerable to different disasters "
"including flood, tsunami, volcano, earthquakes, as well as other localised "
"disasters such as landslides, wildfire and so on. InaSAFE has since been "
"adopted for use in many other countries - it is not 'Indonesia specific'."

"From the beginning, |project_name| has been an open source project (GPL "
"license). This means there are no licensing fees, the software can be freely "
"copied and shared with anyone, and the source codes used to create the "
"software are freely available which means that anyone with a little "
"technical knowledge can contribute to the project. Being an Open Source "
"project is important for us because we want as many people as possible to be "
"able to use and improve the software. If 'better planning saves lives', "
"having a tool that can be used by everyone to do better planning makes "
"sense, right?"

"A key driving force in the ability to use tools such as |project_name| is "
"open access to relevant, up-to-date and well maintained geospatial data. "
"Without roads, buildings, administrative areas, flood and population data "
"etc., a tool like |project_name| would be impossible to use. OpenStreetMap."
"org, WorldPop and many government and non-government agencies around the "
"world have been leading the effort to make such datasets available. We "
"cannot emphasise enough the importance of government in taking a lead role "
"in making their data freely available so that it can be used for the benefit "
"of their citizens."
