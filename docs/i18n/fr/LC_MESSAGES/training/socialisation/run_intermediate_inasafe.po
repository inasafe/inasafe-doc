"In `Run Basic InaSAFE <http://docs.inasafe.org/en/training/socialisation/"
"run_basic_inasafe.html>`__ we learned how to run a flood analysis on "
"population and buildings, adjust the flood impact default settings and "
"analyse impact summary report, and change analysis threshold. We also "
"learned how to save our work and generate a pdf of the analysis results. In "
"this exercise we will learn more techniques such as how to run |"
"project_name| with aggregation data to produce reports broken down by "
"districts or regions. We will also learn how to download data using the "
"OpenStreetMap downloader and how to run |project_name| analysis on the "
"downloaded building polygons and roads. Last but not least, we will learn "
"how to define the analysis area."

"In this exercise, you have learned how to run |project_name| analysis with "
"different hazard data formats and with new type of exposure data. You have "
"also learned two fundamental steps to remember before you run |project_name|:"

"First, you learned how to define a keyword for your data so it can be "
"analysed with |project_name|. Without a keyword, |project_name| will not "
"recognize your data, so you need to define it whether the data is hazard, "
"exposure or aggregation data. You can set the keyword using the :guilabel:"
"`Keyword Creation Wizard` feature."

"Second, it is important to review the analysis area using *Toggle Scenario "
"Outline* before you run |project_name| analysis. This is because, |"
"project_name| sometimes does not automatically set the analysis area "
"according to the intersection of hazard and exposure data. If |project_name| "
"did not set the analysis area, you need to define it manually using the :"
"guilabel:`Set Analysis Area` feature."

"In this exercise, you have learned how to download buildings and roads data "
"from OpenStreetMap using :guilabel:`OpenStreetMap Downloader`. With this "
"feature you can define the size of the area and what type of data you want "
"to download. The availability of the data depends on how complete the data "
"are in OpenStreetMap."
