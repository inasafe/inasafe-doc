"In the previous example, we classified the :guilabel:`vegetasi` layer by "
"what is known as nominal classification. This type of classification is when "
"categories are defined based on names. Next we will classify the :guilabel:"
"`pemukiman` layer based on the size of each feature. Classifying with "
"attributes that contain only positive numbers, such as land area, is known "
"as ratio classification."
